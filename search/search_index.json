It is byte-code interpreted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython can be used in two modes: interactive and scripted. In interactive mode you enter a program fragment and Python evaluates\n  it immediately and then prints the result before prompting for a\n  new input. The interactive prompt is usually rendered as the\n  \nchevron\n \n. In scripted mode your program is stored in one\n  or more files which are executed as one monolithic entity. Such\n  programs behave like ordinary applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython has automatic memory management (via garbage collection). Memory is allocated automatically as needed and freed\n  automatically when no longer used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython 2 versus Python 3\n\n\nCurrently there are two distinct flavours of Python available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython 2 (2.7.10 at the time of writing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython 3 (3.4.3 at the time of writing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython 3 is the new and improved version of the language. Python 3 is\nnot entirely backwards compatible, but the two versions share much in\ncommon. Version 2 is now in maintenance mode; new features will only be\nadded to version 3. The public transition from 2 to 3 has been slower\nthan some people would like. You are encouraged to use version 3 where\npossible. These notes are generally compatible with both versions, but\nwe will point out key differences where necessary.\n\n\nIndentation for grouping code blocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython uses indentation to group code blocks. Most other languages use some kind of brackets for grouping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended style is to use 4 space characters for a single indent (thus 8 spaces for two indents and so forth).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are encouraged \nnot\n to use tabs for indentation because there is no standard width for a tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost good text editors can be configured so that that tab key is rendered as 4 space characters when editing Python code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle Guide\n\n\nA popular style guide for Python is known as \nPEP 0008\n, there is a\ncorresponding tool called \npep8\n which will check your code against\nthe guide and report any transgressions.\n\n\nExample, Python compared to C:\n\n\nPython program for computing factorial:\n\n\n# Compute factorial of n,\n# assuming n \n= 0\n\ndef factorial(n):\n  result = 1\n  while n \n 0:\n      result *= n\n      n -= 1\n  return result\n\nprint(factorial(10))\n\n\n\n\nC program for computing factorial:\n\n\n#include \nstdio.h\n\n\n/* Compute factorial of n,\n  assuming n \n= 0 */\n\nint factorial(int n) {\n   int result = 1;\n\n   while (n \n 0) {\n      result *= n;\n      n -= 1;\n   }\n   return result;\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n   printf(\n%d\\n\n, factorial(10));\n}\n\n\n\n\nThings to note:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference in commenting style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC programs are statically typed, and you must declare the type of functions and variables. Python is dynamically typed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode blocks in C are grouped by braces { }; Python uses indentation for grouping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe C program must have a main function. Python does not require a\n    main function, it just executes the top-level statements of the\n    module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result returned by the C function is limited to the size of a\n    machine integer (say 32 bits). However, the result returned by the\n    Python function is unlimited in its size - it can compute\n    arbitrarily large factorials (up to the limit of the available\n    memory in your computer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\nProgram comments start with a hash character \"#\" and continue until the\nend of the line. There are no multi-line comment markers, but that can\nsometimes be faked with multi-line string literals.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n# This is a comment.\n# This is another comment.\nx = 5 # This is a comment that follows some code.\n'''This is\na multi-line\nstring literal\nwhich can sometimes act like\na\ncomment.\n'''\n\n\n\n\nRunning a Python program\n\n\nThere are many ways to run Python code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can run the interpreter in interactive mode. On Unix (Linux, OS\n    X) you can run the python command at the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have Python code stores in a file, say example.py, you can\n    run it from the command line like so: python example.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use one of several integrated programming environments.\n    Python ships with a fairly minimal one called \nIDLE\n, though\n    many scientists prefer the more comprehensive \nIPython\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your Python code was installed as a package (see below), then it\n    may be executed like an ordinary application without the user\n    being aware of how the program was implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects and types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery value in Python is an \nobject\n (including functions!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects can have attributes and methods, which are accessed via the\n    dot \".\" operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll objects have a type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes are also objects!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython is dynamically typed: you may get type errors at runtime but\n    never at compile time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype(x)\n returns the type of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython variables may be assigned to values of different types at\n    different points in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive examples (Python 3):\n\n\n # Create a list, assign to the variable x\n\n x = [3, 1, 2, 3]\n\n # Ask for the type of the value assigned to x\n\n type(x)\n\nclass 'list'\n\n\n # Ask for the type of the first item in the list (an integer)\n\n type(x[0])\n\nclass 'int'\n\n\n # Count the number of times 3 appears in the list\n\n # by calling the count method\n\n x.count(3)\n2\n\n # Sort the contents of the list in-place.\n\n # Note that this mutates the list object!\n\n # Also note that Python does not print the result in this case.\n\n x.sort()\n\n # Ask Python to show the value of the list\n\n # assigned to the variable x (note it is now sorted)\n\n x\n[1, 2, 3, 3]\n\n # Assign x to an object of a different type (a float)\n\n x = 3.142\n\n type(x)\n\nclass 'float'\n\n\n\n\n\nBooleans\n\n\n\n\nRepresent truth values\n\n\nValues: \nTrue\n, \nFalse\n\n\nType: \nbool\n\n\nOperators: \nand\n, \nor\n, \nnot\n\n\nbool(x)\n will convert x to a boolean. The heuristic is that empty things and zero-ish things are \nFalse\n, everything else is \nTrue\n (but the user can override for their own types).\n\n\nFalse\n values:\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n0\n (zero integer)\n\n\n0.0\n (zero float)\n\n\n{}\n (empty dictionary)\n\n\n()\n (empty tuple)\n\n\n[]\n (empty list)\n\n\n''\n (empty string)\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue\n values:\n\n\neverything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn numerical contexts \nTrue\n is considered equal to the integer \n1\n and\n    \nFalse\n is considered equal to the integer \n0\n. However, these\n    conversions are a common cause of bugs and should be avoided.\n\n\nPython will automatically test the \ntruthiness\n of a value if it\n    appears in a boolean context.\n\n\n\n\nInteractive examples:\n\n\n not True\nFalse\n\n not False\nTrue\n\n not ()\nTrue\n\n not [1,2,3]\nFalse\n\n True and False\nFalse\n\n True and ()\n()\n\n\n\n\nConditional Statements\n\n\n\n\nConditional statements use the keywords: \nif\n, \nelif\n, \nelse\n. The syntax\n    for a conditional statement is:\n\n\n\n\nif expression:\n    statement-block\nelif expression:\n    statement-block\n...\nelse:\n    statement-block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA conditional statement must have exactly one \nif\n part. It may have\n    zero or more \nelif\n parts, and a single optional \nelse\n part at the\n    end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nif\n and \nelif\n parts test the value of their boolean expressions.\n    If the expression evaluates to something which is \nTrue\n or can be\n    converted to \nTrue\n (see the rules for Booleans above) then the\n    statement block immediately beneath that part is executed.\n    Otherwise the following condition (if any) is tried. The \nelse\n\n    part, if it exists, is always and only executed if no preceding\n    condition was \nTrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive examples:\n\n\n if []:\n...     print(\nWas considered True\n)\n... else:\n...     print(\nWas considered False\n)\n...\nWas considered False\n\n\n\n\nNumbers and basic mathematics\n\n\nIntegers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresent whole negative and positive numbers (and zero).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range of integer values is unbounded (up to some limit defined\n    by how much memory you have on your computer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython 2 distinguishes between two integer types \nint\n and \nlong\n, and\n    automatically promotes \nint\n to long where necessary, whereas Python\n    3 considers them all one type called \nint\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase ten is the default literal notation: \n42\n (means \n(4 * 10) + 2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHexadecimal literals start with \n0x\n, octal literals start with \n0o\n,\n    binary literals start with \n0b\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nint(x)\n will try to convert x to an integer, x can be another numeric\n    type (including booleans) or a string.

Python 2 has a separate type for unicode\n    strings, the type is called unicode; literals of this type are\n    prefixed by the letter \nu\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString literals must be quoted. There are 3 quoting styles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsingle quote characters: \n'hello'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndouble quote characters: \n\"hello\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntriple quote characters: \n'''hello'''\n (three single quotes in a\n    row) or \n\"\"\"hello\"\"\"\n (three double quote characters in a row)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single quote and double quote versions of strings have the same\n    value. The purpose of the different quotation styles is to make it\n    convenient to have literal quotation marks inside strings\n    (avoiding the need to escape the quote character). For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis inverted comma won't be a problem inside quotation marks\n\n\nThis inverted comma won't be a problem inside quotation marks\n\n\n 'this \nquote\n will work'\n'this \nquote\n will work'\n\n 'this isn't going to work though'\nFile \nstdin\n, line 1\n'this isn't going to work though'\n^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriple quoted strings can be written on multiple lines. The line\n    breaks will be preserved within the string. Useful for docstrings\n    (see section on functions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe usual set of escape characters are supported:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\n\n newline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\t\n tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\\\n backslash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\'\n single quote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\"\n double quote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand many more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython does not have a separate type for representing individual\n    characters. Instead you use strings of length one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrings are iterable. If you iterate over a string (using a for\n    loop) you process it one character at a time from left to right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrings can be indexed to obtain individual characters, e.g. \ns[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices are zero-based (but you may also use negative indices to\n    access items with respect to the right end of the string).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrings are immutable: you cannot modify a string once it has been\n    created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Examples (Python 3):\n\n\n type(\nhello\n)\n\nclass 'str'\n\n\n \nhello\n == 'hello'\nTrue\n\n '''This string\n... is on\n... multiple\n... lines'''\n'This string\\\\nis on\\\\nmultiple\\\\nlines'\n\n \nbonjour\n.upper()\n'BONJOUR'\n\n len(\nbonjour\n)\n7\n\n \nbonjour\n.startswith(\nb\n)\nTrue\n\n \ncat,sat,flat\n.split(\n,\n)\n['cat', 'sat', 'flat']\n\n # Print the first 5 Chinese unicode characters\n\n print('\\u4E00\\u4E01\\u4E02\\u4E03\\u4E04')\n\u4e00\u4e01\u4e02\u4e03\u4e04\n\n x = \nfloyd\n\n\n x[0]\n'f'\n\n \nhello\n + \n \n + \nworld\n\n'hello world'\n\n\n\n\nExample program:\n\n\n# Prompt the user to input a string:\ninput = raw_input(\nEnter string: \n)\n\n# Count the number of vowels in the input string\nvowels = 'aeiou'\ncount = 0\n\nfor char in input:\n    if char in vowels:\n        count += 1\n\n# Print the count to the standard output\nprint(count)\n\n\n\n\nExample usage of the above program from the operating system command\nprompt, assuming the program is saved in a file called \nvowels.py\n:\n\n\npython vowels.py\nEnter string: abracadabra\n5\n\n\n\n\nLists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresent mutable ordered sequences of values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType: \nlist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList literals are written in between square brackets, e.g. \n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList elements can be objects of any type (including other lists).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike strings, lists can be indexed like so: \nx[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices are zero-based (but you may also use negative indices to\n    access items with respect to the right end of the list).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists are mutable. You can update items, delete items and add new\n    items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexing into a list is a constant time (amortised) operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Examples:\n\n\n type([1, 2, 3])\n\nclass 'list'\n\n\n x = []\n\n len(x)\n0\n\n x.append(\nhello\n)\n\n x\n['hello']\n\n len(x)\n1\n\n x[0]\n'hello'\n\n x.insert(0, True)\n\n x\n[True, 'hello']\n\n del x[1]\n\n x\n[True]\n\n x += [42, \nNewton\n, 3.142]\n\n x\n[True, 42, 'Newton', 3.142]\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresent finite mappings from keys to values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre implemented as \nhash tables\n. The key objects must be hashable\n    (which rules out mutable objects, such as lists).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType: \ndict\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionary literals are written inside curly brackets, with\n    key-value pairs separated by colons: e.g. \n{12: \"XII\", 6: \"VI\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries can be indexed by keys. If the key exists in the\n    dictionary its corresponding value is returned, otherwise a\n    \nKeyError\n exception is raised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of indexing a dictionary is proportional to the time taken\n    to hash the key. For many keys this can be considered constant\n    time. For variable sized objects, such as strings, this can be\n    considered to be proportional to the size of the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIterating over a dictionary yields one key at a time.

In Python 3 it is a\n    function defined in the builtins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy string formatting can be done with the format method on\n    strings. Older Python code uses the string interpolation operator\n    for the same task \n%\n, but its use is now discouraged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles must be opened before than can be manipulated. A file can be\n    opened in different modes: read \n\"r\"\n, write \n\"w\"\n, read-write \n\"r+\"\n,\n    and append \n\"a\"\n. Opening a new file in write or append modes\n    creates a new file. Opening an existing file in write mode\n    overwrites its contents from the start. Opening an existing file\n    in append mode adds new content at the end of the old content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished processing a file you should close it as soon\n    as possible. Closing a file releases limited operating system\n    resources, and ensures that any pending buffered writes a flushed\n    to the storage system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain file types have libraries for convenient processing. One\n    example is the CSV (comma separated values) library for processing\n    tabular data. It is very handy for working with spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command line arguments of a Python program are contained in a\n    list called \nsys.argv\n (it is a variable exported from the \nsys\n\n    module). For complex program you should consider using a command\n    line argument parsing library such as \nargparse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample program:\n\n\n# Count the number of words and lines in a file\n\nimport sys\n\n# Get the input file name from the command line arguments\nfilename = sys.argv[1]\n\n# Open the file\nfile = open(filename)\n\n# Count the number of lines in the file\nnum_lines = 0\nnum_words = 0\n\nfor line in file:\n    num_lines += 1\n    num_words += len(line.split())\n\nfile.close()\n\nprint(\nNumber of lines and words in {}: {} {}\n \\\n        .format(filename, num_lines, num_words))\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Topics\n\n\nClasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses allow you to define your own types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass definitions may define methods for the type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA class may inherit, and possibly override, some functionality from\n    a superclass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass variable(superclass_list):\n    body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the class is given by the variable in the definition.\n    The superclass list defines the superclasses of the new class\n    (very often the base type object is used). The body of the class\n    typically defines one or more methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstances of classes are created by calling the class name as if it\n    were a function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf defined, the special method called \n__init__\n is used to\n    initialise a newly created instance of a class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first parameter to each method is the object upon which the\n    method was called. The convention is to use the variable called\n    self, however any variable name will do. Many object oriented\n    languages make this variable an implicit parameter called this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nclass Vector(object):\n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, z=0):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.z = z\n\n    def magnitude(self):\n        return sqrt(self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2 + self.z ** 2)\n\n    def normalise(self):\n        magnitude = self.magnitude()\n        if magnitude == 0:\n            # Somehow we have a degenerate vector.\n            return self\n        else:\n            return self / self.magnitude()\n\n    def angle(self, other):\n        dp = self.dot_product(other)\n        return acos(dp / self.magnitude() * other.magnitude())\n\n    def dot_product(self, other):\n        return self.x * other.x + self.y * other.y + self.z * other.z\n\n\n\n\nExceptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions allow Python programs to handle erroneous program\n    conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exception is raised (or thrown) at the point of the error and\n    handled (or caught) at some other place in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nException handlers have the syntax:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntry:\n    statement_block\nexcept exception_type as variable:\n    statement_block\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement block after \ntry\n is executed. If no exceptions are\n    raised in that block the program continues immediately after the\n    exception handler. If an exception is raised in the block then\n    program control jumps to the innermost closing \nexcept\n clause.\n    Except clauses may optionally specify the set of exception types\n    that they can handle. If the raised exception is an instance of\n    the handled type then the body of the except clause is executed,\n    otherwise the next except clause (if any) is tried.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no matching exception handler is found then the program will\n    terminate with an unhandled exception error. Python will normally\n    print a stack trace at this point for error diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may raise your own exceptions using the \nraise\n keyword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n# alternative version of the histogram code from the section on\n# dictionaries\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    next_integer = int(line)\n    try:\n        histogram[next_integer] += 1\n    except KeyError:\n        histogram[next_integer] = 1\n\n\n\n\nModules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA module is a file which contains Python code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny Python file you create is automatically a module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is considered good programming style to decompose complex\n    programs into multiple modules. Each module should collect\n    together code with similar purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables defined at the top level of a module (such as global\n    variables, functions and classes) can be imported into other\n    modules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython comes with many standard modules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nimport\n keyword is used to import an entire module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may import a subset of things from a module using the \nfrom ... import ...\n syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may import a module with a new name using the \nfrom ... import ... as ...\n or \nimport ... as ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a module is first imported in a program, all of its top-level\n    statements are executed from top to bottom. Subsequent imports use\n    a cached version of its definitions, its statements are not\n    re-executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA special module called \nbuiltins\n is imported into every other module\n    by default, and it is automatically imported at the interactive\n    prompt in the interpreter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Example:\n\n\n import math\n\n math.sqrt(100)\n10.0\n\n sqrt(100)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \nstdin\n, line 1, in \nmodule\n\nNameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined\n\n from math import sqrt\n\n sqrt(100)\n10.0\n\n import math as m\n\n m.sqrt(100)\n10.0\n\n\n\n\nPackages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA package is a collection of modules in a hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages are the common way to structure Python libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nPython Package Index (PyPI)\n is a big collection of open\n    source packages contributed by the Python community (PyPI contains more than 64 thousand packages at the time of\n    writing).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage installation tools such as \npip\n, make it easy to install\n    packages onto your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your own Python code easy for others to install\n    and use then you should consider making it a package. You can even\n    upload it to PyPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people use \nvirtualenv\n to install packages into a local\n    \"sandboxed\" Python environment. This avoids conflicts with the\n    central Python package database on your computer, and allows\n    multiple different versions of packages to be used.",

C programs are statically typed, and you must declare the type of functions and variables. Python is dynamically typed.

In Python 2, the str type contains ASCII characters (sometimes\n    called byte strings). Python 2 has a separate type for unicode\n    strings, the type is called unicode; literals of this type are\n    prefixed by the letter  u .    String literals must be quoted. There are 3 quoting styles:    single quote characters:  'hello'    double quote characters:  \"hello\"    triple quote characters:  '''hello'''  (three single quotes in a\n    row) or  \"\"\"hello\"\"\"  (three double quote characters in a row)      The single quote and double quote versions of strings have the same\n    value. The purpose of the different quotation styles is to make it\n    convenient to have literal quotation marks inside strings\n    (avoiding the need to escape the quote character).

Instead you use strings of length one.    Strings are iterable. If you iterate over a string (using a for\n    loop) you process it one character at a time from left to right.    Strings can be indexed to obtain individual characters, e.g.  s[5]    Indices are zero-based (but you may also use negative indices to\n    access items with respect to the right end of the string).

It is designed to help you keep track\nof collections of files which stem from a common source and undergo\nmodifications over time. The files tend to be human generated text. It\nis very good at managing source code repositories, but it can also be\nused to manage other things, such as configuration files and text\ndocuments. It is not, however, a file backup system.\n\n\nGit encourages a distributed style of project development. Each\ncontributor to a project has their own complete repository. Changes are\nshared between repositories by \npushing\n changes to, or \npulling\n\nchanges from other repositories. Collaboration between developers is\ngreatly enhanced by websites such as \ngithub\n,\n\nbitbucket\n\nand \ngitorious\n which\nprovide convenient interfaces to managing multiple repositories.\n\n\nThere are many alternatives to git which each have their pros and cons.\nTwo of the more popular alternatives are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubversion\n is particularly suited to a centralised model of development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMercurial\n is very similar to Git, but is sometimes considered more user friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting help\n\n\nThere are lots of resources on the web for learning how to use Git. A\npopular reference is \nPro Git\n, which is freely available online\n(\nhttp://git-scm.com/book\n). Another good\nreference is the book \nVersion Control with Git\n, by Loeliger and\nMcCullough.\n\n\nA simple workflow\n\n\nStep 1, create a github account.\n\n\nCreate a github account (\nhttps://github.com/\n).\nDo this step once only (unless you need multiple accounts).\n\n\nYou get unlimited numbers of (world readable) public repositories for\nfree.\n\n\nPrivate repositories (that can be shared with selected users) cost money\n(see \nhttps://github.com/plans\n), but \ndiscounts are available for academics\n.\n\n\nStep 2, sign into github and create a repository.\n\n\nSign in to your github account and create a new repository. Do this once\nfor every new project you have.\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to provide some information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe repository name\n\n\n\n\n\n\na description of the repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchoose whether it is public (free) or private (costs money)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhether to initialise with a dummy README file (it is useful)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhether to provide an initial .gitignore file (probably leave this\n    \n out in the beginning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3, clone your repository to your local computer.\n\n\nClone your new repository from github to your local computer.\n\n\nEach repository on github is identified by a URL, which will look like\nthe one below:\n\n\n\n\nRun the command below on your development machine in the directory where\nyou want to keep the repository (of course you should use the actual URL\nof your own repository, not the one in the example).\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/bjpop/test.git\nCloning into 'test'...\nremote: Counting objects: 3, done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nUnpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a directory with the same name as your repository (in this example it is called \ntest\n).\n\n\nIf you change into that directory and list its contents you will see a\n\n.git\n subdirectory, which is where Git keeps all the data for your\nrepository. You will also see working copies of the files in the\nproject. In this example the only such file is \nREADME.md\n which was\ncreated automatically by github when the repository was first created.\n(The .md extension on the file suggests that it uses the \nMarkdown\n\nsyntax, see \nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown\n).\n\n\n$ cd test\n$ ls -a\n. .. .git README.md\n$ ls .git\nbranches config description HEAD hooks index info logs objects packed-refs refs\n\n\n\n\nStep 4, commit a file to the repository.\n\n\nCreate a new file in the repository on your local computer and commit it\nto your local repository.\n\n\nHow you create the file is immaterial. You could copy it from somewhere\nelse, create it in a text editor. In this case we\u2019ll make a little\npython program:\n\n\n$ echo 'print(\nhello world\n)' \n hello.py\n\n\n\n\nTest that your new file is satisfactory, in this case we test our code:\n\n\n$ python hello.py\nhello world\n\n\n\n\nCheck the status of your repository:\n\n\n$ git status\n# On branch master\n# Untracked files:\n# (use \ngit add \nfile\n...\n to include in what will be committed)\n#\n# hello.py\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \ngit add\n to track)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that git tells you that the new file \nhello.py\n is not tracked\n(not in the repository).\n\n\nWhen you are happy with your file, you can stage it (this is not a\ncommit), but it will cause the file to be tracked:\n\n\n$ git add hello.py\n\n\n\n\nNote that git uses a two-stage process for committing changes. The first\nstage is to \"stage\" your changes. Staged changes appear in the\nrepository index, but are not committed. You can stage many changes\ntogether, and even amend or undo previously staged (but not committed)\nchanges. The second stage is to commit the current staged changes to the\nrepository. Committing causes the changes to be reflected in the state\nof the repository.\n\n\nRe-check the status of your repository:\n\n\n$ git status\n# On branch master\n# Changes to be committed:\n# (use \ngit reset HEAD \nfile\n...\n to unstage)\n#\n# new file: hello.py\n#\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see that the changes to \nhello.py\n have been staged and are\nready to be committed. Notice that \nhello.py\n is no longer untracked.\n\n\nCommit your changes with a commit message:\n\n\n$ git commit -m \nA little greeting program\n\n[master b1cce11] A little greeting program\n1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\ncreate mode 100644 hello.py\n\n\n\n\nRe-check the status of your repository:\n\n\n$ git status\n# On branch master\n# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.\n#\nnothing to commit (working directory clean)\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that there a no uncommitted changes in the repository,\nhowever git tells us that our local repository is one commit ahead of\nthe github version (which it calls \norigin/master\n).\n\n\nStep 5, push your changes to github.\n\n\nPush the commit in your local repository to github (thus synchronising them).\n\n\n$ git push origin\nUsername for 'https://github.com': \ntype your github username\n\nPassword for 'https://\nyour github username\n@github.com': \nCounting objects: 4, done.\nDelta compression using up to 16 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 305 bytes, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo https://github.com/bjpop/test.git\n71a771a..b1cce11 master -\n master\n\n\n\n\nNow if you look at your repository on github you should see the file\n\nhello.py\n has been uploaded, along with its commit time and commit\nmessage.\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect the contents of the file on github by clicking on its\nname:\n\n\n\n\nStep 6, create a branch in your local repository.\n\n\nYou can ask git to tell you about the names of the current branches:\n\n\n$ git branch\n* master\n\n\n\n\nBy default your repository starts with a branch called master.

It differs\nfrom public GVL servers (such as the\n\nGalaxy Tutorial Server\n,\n\nGalaxy Melbourne\n, and\n\nGalaxy Queensland\n) by providing full\nadministrative access to the server, as well as the full suite of GVL services,\nwhereas public GVL servers provide restricted access for security reasons.\nFor example, public GVL servers do not provide access to the Ubuntu desktop,\nthe Linux command line or JupyterHub at present.\n\n\nAccessing the GVL server is completely free on the Australian NeCTAR Research\nCloud, provided that you have a account with NeCTAR with allocated resources.\n\n\nWhat is NeCTAR?\n\n\nThe \nNational eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project\n\n(NeCTAR) is an Australian programme that provides computing infrastructure\nand services to Australian researchers. The NeCTAR Cloud allows us to\ndeploy virtual machines as a platform for research.\n\n\nWhile it is possible to launch the GVL on \nAmazon\n,\nyou may have to pay Amazon usage charges (the GVL software itself is free).\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Access the NeCTAR dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin into the NeCTAR dashboard at\n    \ndashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\n.\n\n    Only members of the Australian Access Federation (AAF) can access Australian\n    Research Cloud resources. Most Australian universities are members of the\n    AAF, however, if you belong to an institution that is not a member of AAF,\n    \nGVL Help\n may be able to provide you\n    with credentials. You also have the option of using a commercial cloud\n    provider such as \nAWS\n to host your server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose your organisation from the list and login using your credentials.\n    If you are from the University of Melbourne, choose 'The University of\n    Melbourne' and not 'The University of Melbourne (with ECP)'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin with your institutional username and password. If this is the first\n    time you have accessed the Australian Research Cloud, you must agree to some\n    terms and conditions.\n\n\nWhen you log in for the first time, you are automatically allocated a trial\nproject which lasts for 3 months. This trial project allows you to launch a\nmedium instance (with 2 cores) which is sufficient for launching a GVL\ninstance.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have projects which require more compute resources, you can apply\nfor more allocation \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Get your cloud credentials\n\n\nLaunching a GVL instance requires OpenStack API credentials from NeCTAR. These credentials allows the GVL launcher\nto create a new GVL Virtual Machine on your behalf. Obtaining these credentials is a 5 step process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the NeCTAR dashboard, on the left sidebar, navigate to\n\n    Project \n Compute \n Access \n Security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the top \n'API Access'\n tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \n'Download OpenStack RC File'\n button on the top right.\n    A file containing your credentials will be saved to your downloads folder.\n    This file will be needed later in the launch process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext you must obtain your OpenStack password and record it securely for future use.\n    If you have ever done this step before, you should reuse your previously saved\n    password.\n\n\nTo obtain your OpenStack password, click on your username on the top right hand corner\nand go to settings as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the reset password link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce reset, your password will be displayed. Record this securely for all future\n    GVL launches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Launch your personal GVL instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new browser tab, go to \nlaunch.usegalaxy.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the screen below. Select the first option from the list - \"Genomics Virtual Lab\".\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked to login with your preferred social network account.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce logged in, perform the following steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect NeCTAR for the question \"On which cloud would you like to launch your appliance\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"load credentials from file\" and provide file you downloaded in Section 2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide the OpenStack password you obtained in Section 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Test and Use these Credentials\". The Next button will now be activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the next button, and provide the following options.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPassword:\n Choose a strong password and remember it. This is the\n  password you will use later to log into your instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional advanced options\n\n    Toggle the 'Advanced cloudlaunch options' option to see more options. For\n    this tutorial, it is not necessary to modify any of the advanced options.\n\n\n\n\nDeployment name:\n You can override the name with a name of your choice.\n  It is recommended you choose a unique name if you launch multiple instances.\n\n\nInstance type:\n Keep the default: Medium (2 vcpu / 8GB RAM)\n\n\nRoot Volume Storage:\n Keep the default: Instance storage\n\n\nPlacement Zone:\n You can also choose the region of where your server is\n  hosted. If you are doing lots of data transfer, it may be beneficial to\n  pick a location close to your physical location. More information about\n  zones can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKey pair:\n Key pairs are SSH credentials that can be used to access\n  your instance. You can create and import key pairs in the NeCTAR dashboard\n  by navigating to Project \n Compute \n Access \n Security \n Key Pairs and\n  creating or importing a key pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \n'Launch'\n to launch a GVL.\n\n    The launch process takes 2-5 minutes to start the machine and another 5\n    minutes to start and configure Galaxy.\n\n\n\n\nIf an error occurs, or the launch does not complete in 10 minutes, navigate back to the launch page and try\nselecting a different availability zone under the advanced cloudlaunch options -\n \nPlacement Zone\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4: Access your GVL instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your instance has finished launching, click on the Access address\n    to access your GVL dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nIf you accidentally closed the launch page, you can find your access address at any time\nby logging back into \nlaunch.usegalaxy.org\n and navigating\nto the \"My Appliances\" section through the menu bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the GVL dashboard.\n    Have a read through of the services provided by the GVL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 5: GVL services\n\n\nListed below are short descriptions of the services the GVL provides.\n\n\nGalaxy\n\n\nGalaxy\n is a web-based platform for computational\nbiomedical research. The GVL has a number of Galaxy tutorials available\n\nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo begin using Galaxy, register as a user by navigating to User \n Register\non the top Galaxy bar.\n\n\nCloudMan\n\n\nCloudMan is a cloud manager that manages services on your GVL instance. Use\nCloudman to start and manage your Galaxy service and to add additional nodes\nto your compute cluster (if you have enough resources).\n\n\nYou can log into CloudMan by using the username 'ubuntu' and your cluster\npassword.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also shut down your instance (permanently) with CloudMan.\n\n\nLubuntu Desktop\n\n\nLubuntu is a lightweight desktop environment through which you can run desktop\napplications on your virtual machine through your web browser. You can also\naccess the GVL command line utilities through the desktop.\n\n\nYou can log into Lubuntu Desktop using the username 'ubuntu' and your cluster\npassword.\n\n\n\n\nSSH\n\n\nSecure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that allows us to connect to a remotely\nmachine. You can login to your virtual machine remotely through an SSH client.\n\n\nIf you are using Windows, you will need to download an SSH client such as\n\nPuTTY\n. If you are using\nOSX, open up a Terminal window.\n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the command line and UNIX, many\n\ntutorials\n\n\non UNIX\n\n\ncan be\n\n\nfound online\n.\n\n\nYou can ssh into your machine using the either the username 'ubuntu' or the\nusername 'researcher' and using your cluster password. It is recommended to use\nthe researcher account when you are doing your computational research and use\nthe ubuntu account when you need administrative powers (such as installing\nsoftware).\n\n\n\n\nJupyterHub\n\n\nJupyterHub\n is a web-based interactive computational\nenvironment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and\nrich media into a single document. Currently, JupyterHub can connect to Python2\nand Python3 kernals.\n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Python, there are many\n\ntutorials\n\n\navailable\n\n\nonline\n.\n\n\nYou can log into JupyterHub with the username 'researcher' and your cluster\npassword.\n\n\nYou may need to install Python packages you intend to use via the command line\nbeforehand.\n\n\n\n\nRStudio\n\n\nRStudio Server gives browser-based access to RStudio, the popular programming\nand analysis environment for the R programming language. You can find out more\nabout RStudio \nhere\n, and the R programming\nlanguage \nhere\n.\n\n\nYou can log into RStudio with the username 'researcher' and your cluster\npassword.\n\n\n\n\nPublic HTML\n\n\nThis is a shared web-accessible folder. Any files you place in the directory\n\n/home/researcher/public_html\n will be publicly accessible.\n\n\nPacBio SMRT Portal\n\n\nPacBio's SMRT Portal\n is an open source software suite for the analysis of single molecule, real-time sequencing data.\n\n\nBefore you use SMRT Portal, you need to firstly install it through the Admin console. \nPlease note PacBio recommends the use of a 16 core instance with 64GB of RAM (or higher) for this package.\n\n\nTo install SMRT Portal from the GVL dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on 'Admin' in the top navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in with the username 'ubuntu' and your cluster password. The screen will now show all the tools available to be installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to 'SMRT Analysis', and click 'install'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe install is complete when SMRT Portal is available as a tool on the GVL dashboard, and a green tick is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen launching SMRT Portal for the first time, you will need to register yourself as a new user.\n\n\n\n\nSection 6: Shutting your machine down\n\n\nThere are two ways to terminate your instance. Terminating your instance is\npermanent and all data will be deleted (unless you have persistent\n\nvolume storage\n which you will\nneed to apply for).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia Cloudman\n\n    Log into CloudMan by using the username 'ubuntu' and your cluster password.\n    Click the \nShut down...\n button under Cluster Controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia the NeCTAR dashboard\n\n    Navigate to the \nInstances\n\n    page by navigating to Project \n Compute \n Instances on the left panel. Find\n    the instance you want to terminate, and on the right-most column (Actions),\n    click on the arrow button, and select \nTerminate Instance\n.",

It comes with most of the popular bioinformatics tools already installed and ready for use. There are many Galaxy servers around the world and some are tailored with specific toolsets and reference data for analysis of human genomics, microbial genomics, proteomics etc.\n\n\nThere are some introductory slides available \nhere\n.\n\n\nBasically, the Galaxy interface is separated into 3 parts. The tool list on the left, the viewing pane in the middle and the analysis and data history on the right. We will be looking at all 3 parts in this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop/tutorial will familiarize you with the Galaxy interface. It will cover the following topics:\n\n\n\n\nLogging in to the server\n\n\nGetting data into galaxy\n\n\nHow to access the tools\n\n\nUsing to use some common tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial you should:\n\n\n\n\nBe able to register on and login to a Galaxy server.\n\n\nBe able to upload data to a Galaxy server from:\n\n\nA file on your local computer\n\n\nA file on a remote datastore with an accessible URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe able use tools in Galaxy by:\n\n\nAccessing the tool via the tool menu\n\n\nUsing the tool interface to run the particular tool\n\n\nViewing/accessing the tool output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Preparation.\n\n\nThe purpose of this section is to get you to log in to the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your browser. We recommend Firefox or Chrome (please don't use Internet Explorer or Safari). \n\n\n\n\nGo to the \nGalaxy-Mel\n server. \n\n\nAlternatively, you can use a different Galaxy server - a list of available servers is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have previously registered on this server just log in:\n\n\n\n\nOn the top menu select: \nUser -\n Login\n\n\nEnter your password\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t registered on this server, you\u2019ll need to now.\n\n\n\n\nOn the top menu select: \nUser -\n Register\n\n\nEnter your email, choose a password, repeat it and add a (all lower case) one word name\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Getting data into Galaxy\n\n\nThere are 2 main ways to get your data into Galaxy. We will use each of these methods for 3 files and then use those 3 files for the rest of the workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a new history for this workshop. To do this:\n\n\n\n\nClick on the history menu button (the \n icon) at the top of the Histories panel.\n\n\nSelect \nCreate New\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that Galaxy has the concept of \"File Type\" built in. This means that each file stored needs to have its type described to Galaxy as it is being made available. Examples of file types are: text, fasta, fastq, vcf, GFF, Genbank, tabular etc.\n\n\nWe will tell Galaxy what type of file each one is as we upload it.\n\n\nMethod 1: Upload a file from your own computer\n\n\nWith this method you can get most of the files on your own computer into Galaxy. (there is a size limit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the following file to your computer: \nhttps://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/galaxy101/Contig_stats.txt.gz\n\n\n\n\n(To download this file, copy the link into a new browser tab, and press enter. The file should now download.)\n\n\nFrom the Galaxy tool panel, click on \nGet Data -\n Upload File\n\n\nClick the \nChoose File\n button\n\n\nFind and select the \nContig_stats.txt.gz\n file you downloaded and click \nOpen\n\n\nSet the \"Type\" (= file format) to \ntabular\n\n\nClick the \nStart\n button\n\n\nOnce the progress bar reaches 100%, click the \nClose\n button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file will now upload to your current history.\n\n\nMethod 2: Upload a file from a URL\n\n\nIf a file exists on a web resource somewhere and you know its URL (Unique resource location - a web address) you can directly load it into Galaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nGet Data -\n Upload File\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nPaste/Fetch Data\n button\n\n\nCopy and paste the following web address into the URL/Text box: \nhttps://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/COMP90014/Assignment1/bacterial_std_err_1.fastq.gz\n\n\nSet the file format to \nfastqsanger\n (not fastqcsanger)\n\n\nClick \nStart\n\n\nOnce the progress bar has reached 100%, click \nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that Galaxy is smart enough to recognize that this is a compressed file and so it will uncompress it as it loads it.\n\n\nMethod 2 (again): Get data from a public URL\n\n\nNow we are going to upload another file from the remote data source.\n\n\nRepeat the above for: \nhttps://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/MRSA0252.fna\n\n\nNote that this file is a \nfasta\n file and not a \nfastqsanger\n file.\n\n\n\n\nReveal detailed instructions\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nGet Data -\n Upload File\n\n\nClick on the \nPaste/Fetch Data\n button\n\n\nCopy and paste the following web address into the URL/Text box: https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/MRSA0252.fna\n\n\nSet the file format to \nfasta\n.\n\n\nClick \nStart\n\n\nOnce the progress bar has reached 100%, click \nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DNA sequence of \nStaphlococcus aureus MRSA252\n will be loaded into your history as a fasta file.\n\n\nYour history should now look like this.\n\n\n\n\nThe data\n\n\nThough we aren't going to focus on the contents of these files and what they mean from a bioinformatics standpoint, here is a brief description of each one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigs_stats.txt\n\n\n\n\nthis file contains a table of summary data from a de novo genome assembly (the process of attempting to recover the full genome of an organism from the short read sequences produced by most DNA sequencing machines. )\n\n\nThe columns contain a lot of information but the ones we will be using indicate the amount of data (or coverage) that went into making up each piece of the final assembly.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbacterial_std_err_1.fastq.gz\n\n\n\n\nThis file contains sequence reads as they would come off an Illumina sequencing machine. They are in \nfastq\n format.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRSA0252.fna\n\n\n\n\nThis file contains the genome sequence of \nStaphylococcus aureus MRSA252\n. It is in \nfasta\n format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Play with the tools\n\n\nThe purpose of this section is to get you used to using the available tools in Galaxy and point out some of the more basic manipulation tools.\n\n\nFirstly however, you\u2019ll notice that two of the files have very long and confusing names. So we might want to change them. To do this we need to \u201cedit\u201d the file. So:\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \n icon (edit) next to the file in the history called: \nhttps://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/COMP90014/Assignment1/bacterial_std_err_1.fastq\n\n\nIn the \"Name\" text box, give it a new name. Call it: \nTypical Fastq File\n\n\nClick the \nSave\n button.\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the process for the MRSA252 fasta file. Rename it to \nMRSA252.fna\n\n\nNow that\u2019s better. There was a lot of other functionality hidden behind that edit (\n) icon. You can change a file\u2019s data type, convert its format and many other things. Feel free to play around with them at a later date.\n\n\nOk, back to the tools.\n\n\nExample 1: Histogram and summary statistics\n\n\nThe first thing we are going to do is produce a histogram of contig read coverage depths and calculate the summary statistics from the Contig_stats.txt file. To do this we need to cut out a couple of columns, remove a line and then produce a histogram. This will introduce some of the text manipulation tools.\n\n\nClick on the \n icon of the \nContig_stats.txt\n file to have a look at it. Note that there are 18 columns in this file. We want column 1 and column 6. To do this:\n\n\n1. Cut out column 1 and column 6.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nText Manipulation -\n Cut\n and set the following:\n\n\nSet \"Cut Columns\" to: \nc1,c6\n\n\n\"Delimited by\": \nTab\n\n\n\"Cut from\": \nContig_stats.txt\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nExamine the new file by clicking on its \n icon. We now have 2 columns instead of the 18 in the original file.\n\n\n2. Remove the Header lines of the new file.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nText Manipulation -\n Remove beginning\n and set the following:\n\n\n\"Remove First\": \n1\n\n\n\"from\": \nCut on data1\n\n\nclick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nNote the the new file is the same as the previous one without the header line.\n\n\n3. Make a histogram.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nGraph/Display Data -\n Histogram\n and set the following:\n\n\n\"Dataset\": \nRemove beginning on Data X\n\n\n\"Numerical column for X axis\": \nc2\n\n\n\"Number of breaks\": \n25\n\n\n\"Plot title\": \nHistogram of Contig Coverage\n\n\n\"Label for X axis\": \nCoverage depth\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \n icon of the histogram to have a look at it. Note there are a few peaks. Maybe these correspond to single, double and triple copy number of these contigs.\n\n\n4. Calculate summary statistics for contig coverage depth.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nStatistics -\n Summary Statisitics\n and set the following:\n\n\n\"Summary statistics on\": \nRemove beginning on Data X\n\n\n\"Column or expression\": \nc2\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll note that the summary statistics tool failed and is red in the history. There was an error! If you click on the filename, and then the bug \n symbol, it will tell you what went wrong. (There is a missing python library.) At this point, you would normally contact your Galaxy server administrator.\n\n\nExample 2: Convert Fastq to Fasta\n\n\nThis shows how to convert a fastq file to a fasta file. The tool creates a new file with the converted data.\n\n\nConverter tool\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nConvert Formats -\n FASTQ to FASTA\n and set the following:\n\n\n\"FASTQ file to convert\": \nTypical Fastq File\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nThis will have created a new Fasta file called FASTQ to FASTA on data 2.\n\n\nExample 3: Find Ribosomal RNA Features in a DNA Sequence\n\n\nThis example shows how to use a tool called \u201cbarrnap\u201d to search for rRNAs in a DNA sequence.\n\n\n1. Find all of the ribosomal RNA's in a sequence\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nNGS: Annotation -\n barrnap\n and set the following:\n\n\n\"Fasta file\": MRSA252.fna\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nA new file called \nbarrnap on data 3\n will be produced. It is a gff3 file. (This stands for genome feature format - version 3. It is a file format for describing features contained by a DNA sequence.) Change its name to something more appropriate (click on the \n icon.) \n\n\nNow let's say you only want the lines of the file for the 23S rRNA annotations. We can do this using a Filter tool.\n\n\n2. Filter the annotations to get the 23S RNAs\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nFilter and Sort -\n Select\n and set the following:\n\n\n\"Select lines from\":  (whatever you called the barrnap gff3 output)\n\n\n\"that\": \nMatching\n\n\n\"the pattern\": \n23S\n     (this will look for all the lines in the file that contain \u201c23S\u201d)\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nNow you have a gff3 file with just the 23S annotations!\n\n\nWhat now?\n\n\nRemember how we started a new history at the beginning? If you want to see any of your old histories, click on the history menu button \n at the top of the histories panel and then select \u201cSaved Histories.\u201d This will give you a list of all the histories you have worked on in this Galaxy server.\n\n\nThat's it. You now know a bit about the Galaxy interface and how to load data, run tools and view their outputs. For more tutorials, see \nhttp://genome.edu.au/learn",

It will cover the following topics:\n\n\n\n\nLogging in to the server\n\n\nHow to construct and use a workflow by various methods\n\n\nHow to share a workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Preparation.\n\n\nThe purpose of this section is to get you to log in to the server.. For this workshop, you can use a Galaxy server that you have created by following the steps outlined in: \nLaunch a GVL Galaxy Instance\n or you can use the public \nGalaxy-mel\n\n\nGo to Galaxy URL of your server in Firefox or Chrome (your choice, please don't use IE or Safari.)\n\n\n\n\nIf you have previously registered on this server just log in:\n\n\nOn the top menu select: \nUser -\n Login\n\n\nEnter your password\n\n\nClick the \nSubmit\n button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t registered on this server, you\u2019ll need to now.\n\n\nOn the top menu select: \nUser -\n Register\n\n\nEnter your email, choose a password, repeat it and add a (all lower case) one word name\n\n\nClick on the \nSubmit\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Create and run a workflow.\n\n\nThis section will show you two different methods to create a workflow and then how to run one.\n\n\nImport the workflow history\n\n\nIn this step we will import a shared history to our workspace so we can extract a workflow from it. This will only work on Galaxy servers which have the history available on it. If yours doesn't have the appropriate history, there are instructions to create it \nhere\n. Alternatively, you can extract a workflow from any history you have in your \"Saved Histories.\"\n\n\n\n\nFrom the menu at the top of the Galaxy window, click \nShared Data -\n Histories\n\n\nFind the history called \"\nworkflow_finished\n\" and click on it.\n\n\nThen click on \nImport history\n at the top right of the screen.\n\n\nChange the name if you wish and then click \nImport\n\n\n\n\nThis history should now be in your history pane on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow creation: Method 1\n\n\nWe will create a workflow from an existing history. You can use this method to make a re-useable analysis from one you\u2019ve already done. i.e. You can perform the analysis once and then create a workflow out of it to re-use it on more/new data. We will create a workflow from the history you imported in step 1 above. The footnote below explains the steps that created this history. These are the steps we will mimic in the workflow.\n\n\nMake sure your current history is the one you imported in Section 2 - Step 1 above (\nimported: workflow_finished.\n) If not, switch to it. If you couldn't import it, you should be able to complete this step with any suitable history.\n\n\nNow we will create the workflow.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the histories menu button \n at the top of the history pane.\n\n\nClick \nExtract Workflow\n\n\n\n\nYou will now be shown a page which contains the steps used to create the history you are extracting from. We use this page to say what to include in the workflow. We want everything here so we\u2019ll just accept the defaults and:\n\n\n\n\nChange the Workflow name to something sensible like \u201cBasic Variant Calling Workflow\u201d\n\n\nClick \nCreate Workflow\n\n\n\n\nThe workflow is now accessible via the bottom of the tool pane by clicking on All Workflows.\n\n\nSome discussion\n\n\nHave a look at your workflow. Click on its button in the workflow list. It\u2019s tool interface will appear. You can now run this workflow any time you like with different input datasets. NOTE: The input data sets must be of the same types as the original ones. i.e. In our case, two fastq reads files and one fasta reference sequence.\n\n\nMore interesting though is to:\n\n\n\n\nClick on the  \nWorkflows\n link in the top menu\n\n\nClick on the down arrow on your workflow\u2019s button.\n\n\nClick \nEdit\n\n\n\n\nA visualisation of your workflow will appear. Note the connections and the steps.\n\n\nNext we\u2019ll go through how to create this workflow using the editor..\n\n\nWorkflow Creation: Method 2\n\n\nWe will now create the same read mapping/variant calling workflow using the editor directly. The workflow needs to take in some reads and a reference, map the reads to the reference using BWA, run Freebayes on the BAM output from BWA to call the variants, and finally filter the resulting vcf file.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a workflow name and edit space.\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nWorkflow\n in Galaxy\u2019s menu.\n\n\nClick on the \nCreate New Workflow\n button.\n\n\nIn the \"Workflow Name\" text box type: \nVariants from scratch\n\n\nClick the \nCreate\n button.\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be presented with a blank workflow editing grid.\n\n\nStep 2: Open the editor and place component tools\n\n\nAdd three input datafiles.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Workflow control section of the tool pane, click on \nInputs -\n Input dataset\n three times.\n\n\nSpread them out towards the left hand side of the workflow grid by clicking and dragging them around.\n\n\nFor each one, change their name.\n\n\nClick on each input box in turn\n\n\nIn the right hand pane (where the history usually is), change the name to:\n\n\nReference data\n\n\nReads 1\n\n\nReads 2 - respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you click on \nInput dataset\n in the tan box at the top of the right hand panel on the screen, you can change the name of the box as it appears on the editing layout. You need to give each one a more sensible name and press \nEnter\n to make the change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd in the BWA mapping step.\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nNGS: Mapping -\n Map with BWA\n in the tool pane. BWA will be added to the workflow grid.\n\n\nIn the right hand pane (where the history usually is), change the following parameters.\n\n\nChange \u201cWill you select a reference genome from your history or use a built-in index?:\u201d to \nUse a genome from history.\n\n\nNote that the BWA box on the grid changes to match these settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the tools together.\n\n\n\n\nClick and drag on the output of one of the input dataset tools to each of the input spots in the BWA tool. (Make connections.)\n\n\n\"Reference data\" output to reference to \"Use the following dataset as the reference sequence\"\n\n\n\"Reads 1\" output to \"Select first set of reads\"\n\n\n\"Reads 2\" output to \"Select second set of reads\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd in the Freebayes (Variant Calling step.)\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nNGS: Variant Calling -\n Freebayes\n\n\nIn the right hand pane, change the following:\n\n\n\"Choose the source for the reference list:\"  to \nHistory\n\n\nConnect \"Map with BWA\" bam output to \"Freebayes\u2019\" bam input.\n\n\nConnect the \"Reference data\" output to \"Freebayes\u2019\" \nUse the following dataset as the reference sequence\n input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re keen - \nNote: this is optional.\n Also change the following parameters the right hand pane for freebayes to make it a bit more sensible for variant calling in bacterial genomes.\n\n\n\n\n\"Choose parameter selection level\": \nComplete list of all options\n\n\n\"Population model options\": \nSet population model options\n\n\n\"Set ploidy for the analysis\": \n1\n\n\n\"Input filters\": \nSet input filters\n\n\n\"Exclude alignments from analysis if they have a mapping quality less than\": \n20\n\n\n\"Exclude alleles from analysis if their supporting base quality is less than\": \n20\n\n\n\"Require at least this fraction of observations \u2026 to evaluate the position\": \n0.9\n\n\n\"Require at least this count of observations .. to evaluate the position\": \n10\n\n\n\"Population and mappability priors\": \nSet population and mappability priors\n\n\n\"Disable incorporation of prior expectations about observations\": \nYes\n\n\n\n\nAdd in the Filter step.\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nFilter and Sort - \n Filter\n\n\nConnect \"Freebayes\u2019\" output_vcf to the \"filter\" input.\n\n\nIn the right hand pane, change the following:\n\n\n\"With the following condition\": \nc6 \n 500\n\n\n\"Number of header lines to skip\": \n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew! We\u2019re nearly done! The only thing left is to select which workflow outputs we want to keep in our history. Next to each output for every tool is a star. Clicking on the stars will select those files as workflow outputs, everything else will be hidden in the history. In this case we only really want the BAM file and the final variants (vcf file.) Therefore:\n\n\nSelect workflow outputs.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the star next to \"Map with BWA\u2019s\" bam file output.\n\n\nClick on the star next to \"Filter\u2019s\" output vcf.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Save it!\n\n\nClick on the \n at the top of the workflow grid and select \nSave\n.\n\n\nCongratulations. You\u2019ve just created a Galaxy workflow.\n\n\nNow to run it!\n\n\nRunning the workflow\n\n\nWe will now make a new history called \"Test\" and run the workflow on it\u2019s data.\n\n\nCreate the new history\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Histories Menu, select \nCopy Datasets\n\n\nSelect the 2 x fastq files and the Ecoli .fna file.\n\n\nUnder destination history, enter \nTest\n into \"New History Named:\"\n\n\nClick \nCopy History Items\n button\n\n\nClick on the link to the new history in the green bar at the top of the screen\n\n\n\n\nRun the workflow\n\n\n\n\nOn the tools pane, click \nAll Workflows\n\n\nSelect the \nVariants from scratch\n workflow (or whatever you called it.)\n\n\nGive it the correct files.\n\n\nEcoli ... .fna\n for Reference data\n\n\nbacterial_std_err_1.fastq\n for Reads 1\n\n\nbacterial_std_err_2.fastq\n for Reads 2\n\n\nClick \nRun Workflow\n\n\n\n\nYour workflow will now run. It will send the right files to the right tools at the right time to the cluster (compute engine on your machine) and wait for them to finish. Watch as they turn yellow then green in turn.\n\n\nWhat now?\n\n\nWhere to start? There\u2019s so much you can do with Workflows. You can even run them on multiple file sets from the one setup.",

We filter the variants manually to understand what is actually happening in variant calling. In practice the datasets would be much larger and you would carry out some extra steps to improve the quality of the called variants.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial you should:\n\n\n\n\nBe familiar with the FASTQ format and base quality scores\n\n\nBe able to align reads to generate a BAM file and subsequently generate a pileup file\n\n\nBe able to run the FreeBayes variant caller to find SNVs and indels\n\n\nBe able to visualise BAM files using the \nIntegrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)\n and identify likely SNVs and indels by eye\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nSome background reading material - \nbackground\n\n\nWhere is the data in this tutorial from?\n\n\nThe workshop is based on analysis of short read data from the exome of chromosome 22 of a single human individual. There are one million 76bp reads in the dataset, produced on an Illumina GAIIx from exome-enriched DNA. This data was generated as part of the \n1000 genomes\n Genomes project.\n\n\n\n\n1. Preparation\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have an instance of Galaxy ready to go.\n\n\nFor example, you can use the \nGalaxy Melbourne server\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new history for this tutorial.\n\n\nIn the history pane, click on the cog icon at the top right. \n\n\nClick \nCreate New\n.\n\n\nClick on \nUnnamed history\n and re-name it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport data for the tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we are uploading a \nFASTQ\n file.\n\n\nMethod 1\n\n\nPaste/Fetch data from a URL to Galaxy.\n\n\nIn the Galaxy tools panel (left), click on \nGet Data\n and choose \nUpload File\n.\n\n\nClick \nPaste/Fetch data\n and paste the following URL into the box\n\n\nhttps://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/VariantDet_BASIC/NA12878.GAIIx.exome_chr22.1E6reads.76bp.fastq\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nType\n as \nfastqsanger\n and click \nStart\n.\n\n\nOnce the upload status turns \ngreen\n, it means the upload is complete. You should now be able to see the file in the Galaxy history panel (right).\n\n\nThe dataset will have a very long name, as it's named after the full URL we got it from. Optionally, once the file is in your History, click the pencil icon in the upper-right corner of the green dataset box, then select the \nName\n box and give the file a shorter name by removing the URL. Then click \nSave\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if you have a local file to upload (\nFor the purpose of this tutorial we can stick with the option above\n):\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2\n\n\nUpload data to Galaxy.\n\n\nIn the Galaxy tools panel (left), click on \nGet Data\n and choose \nUpload File\n.\n\n\nFrom \nChoose local file\n select the downloaded FASTQ file. Select \nType\n as \nfastqsanger\n and click \nStart\n.\n\n\nOnce the upload status turns \ngreen\n, it means the upload is complete. You should now be able to see the file in the Galaxy history panel (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nSo far, we have started a Galaxy instance, got hold of our data and uploaded it to\nthe Galaxy instance.\n\nNow we are ready to perform our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n2. Quality Control\n\n\nThe first step is to evaluate the quality of the raw sequence data. If the quality is poor, then adjustments can be made - e.g. trimming the short reads, or adjusting your expectations of the final outcome!\n\n\n1. Take a look at the FASTQ file\n\n\n\n\nClick on the eye icon to the top right of the fastq file to view the a snippet of the file.\n\n\nNote that each read is represented by 4 lines:\n\n\nread identifier\n\n\nshort read sequence\n\n\nseparator\n\n\nshort read sequence quality scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne.g.\nidentifier:    @61CC3AAXX100125:7:72:14903:20386/1\nread sequence: TTCCTCCTGAGGCCCCACCCACTATACATCATCCCTTCATGGTGAGGGAGACTTCAGCCCTCAATGCCACCTTCAT\nseparator:     +\nquality score: ?ACDDEFFHBCHHHHHFHGGCHHDFDIFFIFFIIIIHIGFIIFIEEIIEFEIIHIGFIIIIIGHCIIIFIID?@\n6\n\n\n\n\nFor more details see \nFASTQ\n.\n\n\n2. Assessing read quality from the FASTQ files\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Galaxy tools panel, select \nNGS: QC and manipulation \n FastQC: Read Quality reports\n.\n\nThe input FASTQ file will be selected by default. Keep the other defaults and click execute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Tip:\n   Note the batch processing interface of Galaxy:\n\n   \n\n   \n grey = waiting in queue\n\n   \n yellow = running\n\n   \n green = finished\n\n   \n red = tried to run and failed\n   \n\n\n\n\nWhen the job has finished, click on the eye icon to view the newly generated data (in this case a set of quality metrics for the FASTQ data). This will be a file called \nFastQC on data 1: Web page\n. \nLook at the various quality scores. The data looks pretty good - \nhigh Per base sequence quality\n (avg. above 30).\n\n\nNote that the 'Sequence Duplication Levels' are marked as high. Normally we would run another tool to remove duplicates (technical PCR artifacts) but for the sake of brevity we will omit this step.\n\n\n\n\n3. Alignment to the reference - (FASTQ to BAM)\n\n\nThe basic process here to map individual reads - from the input sample FASTQ file - to a matching region on the reference genome.\n\n\n1. Align the reads with BWA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap/align the reads with the \nBWA\n tool to Human reference genome 19 (hg19) \nUCSC hg19\n.\n    From the Galaxy tools panel, select\n\n\n\nNGS: Mapping \n Map with BWA-MEM [3-5mins]\n\n\n\nFrom the options:\n\nUsing reference genome: set to hg19\n\nSingle or Paired-end reads: set to Single\n\n\n\nMake sure your fastq file is the input file.\n\n\nKeep other options as default and click execute.\n\n\n\n\nNote: This is the longest step in the workshop and will take a few minutes, possibly more depending on how many people are also scheduling mappings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSort the BAM file.\n  From the Galaxy tools panel, select\n\n\n\nNGS: SAM Tools \n Sort BAM dataset\n\n\n\nFrom the options:\n\n\nBAM File: set to the output from the alignment BAM file\n\n\nSort by: Chromosomal coordinates\n\n\nKeep other options as default and click execute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Examine the alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo examine the output sorted BAM file, we need to first convert it into readable \nSAM\n format.\n  From the Galaxy tools panel, select\n\n\n\nNGS: SAM Tools \n BAM-to-SAM\n\n\n\nFrom the options:\n\n\nBAM File to Convert: set to the output to the sorted BAM file\n\n\nKeep other options as default and click execute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the generated Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) file.\n\n\n\n\nClick the eye icon next to the newly generated file\n\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the \nSAM\n format\n\n\nNote that some reads have mapped to non-chr22 chromosomes (see column 3).\n\n\n\n\nThis is the essence of alignment algorithms - the aligner does the best it can, but because of compromises in accuracy vs performance and repetitive sequences in the genome, not all the reads will necessarily align to the \u2018correct\u2019 sequence or could this be suggesting the presence of a structural variant?\n\n\n\n\n\nTip:\nGalaxy auto-generates a name for all outputs. Therefore, it is advisable to choose a more meaningful name to these outputs.\n\n\nThis can be done as follows:\n\n\nClick on the pencil icon (edit attributes) and change Name e.g. Sample.bam or Sample.sam or Sample.sorted.bam etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Assess the alignment data\n\n\nWe can generate some mapping statistics from the BAM file to assess the quality of our alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun IdxStats. From the Galaxy tools panel, select\n    \n\n    \nNGS: SAM Tools \n IdxStats\n\n    \n\n    Select the sorted BAM file as input. Keep other options as default and click execute.\n    \n\n    \n\n\nIdxStats generates a tab-delimited output with four columns.\nEach line consists of a reference sequence name (e.g. a chromosome),\nreference sequence length, number of mapped reads and number of placed but\nunmapped reads.\n\n\nWe can see that most of the reads are aligning to chromosome 22 as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Flagstat. From the Galaxy tools panel, select\n    \n\n    \nNGS: Sam Tools \n Flagstat\n\n    \n\n    From the options:\n    \n\n    The BAM: select the sorted BAM file\n    \n\n    Keep other options as default and click execute\n    \n\n    \n\n\nNote that in this case the statistics are not very informative. This is because the dataset has been generated for this workshop and much of the noise has been removed (and in fact we just removed a lot more noise in the previous step); also we are using single ended read data rather than paired-end so some of the metrics are not relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Visualise the BAM file.\n\n\nTo visualise the alignment data:\n\n\n\n\nClick on the sorted BAM file dataset in the History panel.\n\n\nClick on \"Display with IGV \nweb current\n\". This should download a .jnlp\n    Java Web Start file to your computer. Open this file to run IGV.\n    (You will need Java installed on your computer to run IGV). NOTE: If IGV is already open on your computer, you can click \"\nlocal\n\" instead of \"web current\", and this will open the BAM file in your current IGV session.\n\n\nOnce IGV opens, it will show you the BAM file. This may take a bit of time as the data is downloaded.\n\n\nOur reads for this tutorial are from chromosome 22, so select \nchr22\n from the second\n    drop box under the toolbar. Zoom in to view alignments of reads to the reference genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry looking at region \nchr22:36,006,744-36,007,406\n\n\nCan you see a few variants?  \n\n\n\n\nDon't close IGV yet as we'll be using it later.\n\n\n\n\n5. Generate a pileup file\n\n\nA pileup is essentially a column-wise representation of the aligned reads - at the base level - to the reference. The pileup file summarises all data from the reads at each genomic region that is covered by at least one read. Each row of the pileup file gives similar information to a single vertical column of reads in the IGV view.\n\n\nThe current generation of variant calling tools do not output pileup files, and you don't need to do this section in order to use FreeBayes in the next section. However, a pileup file is a good illustration of the evidence the variant caller is looking at internally, and we will produce one to see this evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a pileup file:\n\n\nFrom the Galaxy tools panel, select\n\n\n\nNGS: SAMtools \n Generate Pileup\n\n\n\nFrom the options:\n\nCall consensus according to MAQ model = Yes\n\nThis generates a called 'consensus base' for each chromosomal position.\n\n\n\nKeep other options as default and click execute\n\n\n\n\nFor each output file, Galaxy tries to assign a datatype attribute to every file. In this case, you'll need to manually assign the datatype to \npileup\n.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, rename the output to something more meaningful by clicking on the pencil icon\n\n\nTo change the datatype, click on the Datatype link from the top tab while you're editing attributes.\n\n\nFor downstream processing we want to tell Galaxy that this is a \npileup\n file. From the drop-down, select Pileup and click save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tip:\nThe pileup file we generated has 10 columns:\n\n\n 1. chromosome\n\n\n 2. position\n\n\n 3. current reference base\n\n\n 4. consensus base from the mapped reads\n\n\n 5. consensus quality\n\n\n 6. SNV quality\n\n\n 7. maximum mapping quality\n\n\n 8. coverage\n\n\n 9. bases within reads\n\n\n 10. quality values\n\n\nFurther information on (9):\n\nEach character represents one of the following (the longer this string, higher the coverage):\n  \n\n  \n . = match on forward strand for that base\n  \n , = match on reverse strand\n  \n ACGTN = mismatch on forward\n  \n acgtn = mismatch on reverse\n  \n +[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' = insertion between this reference position and the next\n  \n -[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' = deletion between this reference position and the next\n  \n ^ = start of read\n  \n $ = end of read\n  \n BaseQualities = one character per base in ReadBases, ASCII encoded Phred scores\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter the pileup file:\n\n\nIf you click the eye icon to view the contents of your pileup file, you'll see that the visible rows of the file aren't very interesting as they are outside chromosome 22 and have very low coverage. Let's filter to regions with coverage of at least 10 reads.\n  \n\n  From the Galaxy tools panel, select:\n  \n\n  \nNGS: SAM Tools \n Filter Pileup\n\n  \n\n  From the options:\n\n  which contains = Pileup with ten columns (with consensus)\n\n  Do not report positions with coverage lower than = 10\n\n\nTry this filtering step two ways:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, set the parameter \nOnly report variants?\n to \nNo\n. This will give you all locations with a coverage of at least 10 and sufficient read quality. This is similar to the information you see when you look at IVG: each pilup row corresponds to a column of aligned bases at one genomic location.\n\n\nThen, repeat the step but set \nOnly report variants?\n to \nYes\n. This will effectively do variant calling: it will give you only locations that have some evidence that there might be a variant present. This variant calling is not very stringent, so you will still get lots of rows. We could filter further to, for instance, variants with high quality scores.\n\n\n\n\nExamine your two pileup files and understand the difference between them. Which coordinates are present in each? What do the bases look like in one compared to the other? Compare the variant quality score (in column 6) to the bases listed on each row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Call variants with FreeBayes\n\n\nFreeBayes is a Bayesian variant caller which assesses the likelihood of each possible genotype for each position in the reference genome, given the observed reads at that position, and reports back the list of possible variants. We look at it in more detail in the \nAdvanced Variant Calling\n tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall variants with FreeBayes.\n Under \nNGS ANALYSIS\n, select the tool \nNGS: Variant Analysis -\n FreeBayes\n.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your sorted BAM file as input, and select the correct reference genome.\n\n\nUnder \nChoose parameter selection level\n, select \"Simple diploid calling with filtering and coverage\". This will consider only aligned reads with sufficient mapping quality and base quality. You can see the exact parameters this sets by scrolling down in the main Galaxy window to the Galaxy FreeBayes documentation section on \nGalaxy-specific options\n.\n\n\nExecute\n FreeBayes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the generated list of variants\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick the eye icon to examine the VCF file contents. The VCF format is described below - make sure you can identify the header rows and the data, and understand the important columns.\n\n\nHow many variants exactly are in your list? (Hint: you can look at the number of lines in the dataset, listed in the green box in the History, but remember the top lines are header lines.)\n\n\nWhat sort of quality scores do your variants have?\n\n\n\n\nFreeBayes, like most variant callers, produces a \nVariant Call Format (VCF)\n file.\n\n\nVCF consists of a header section and a data section. The header section has some information about the file and the parameters used to produce it. The header also specifies what information is stored in the INFO, FILTER and FORMAT columns, as this is different for different variant callers.\n\n\nThe data section has several columns. For this tutorial, you should concentrate on CHROM, POS, REF, ALT and QUAL. CHROM and POS describe the variant's genomic location, REF and ALT describe the variant's nucleotides relative to the reference, and QUAL is a quality score giving FreeBayes' confidence in the correctness of this variant call.\n\n\nThe columns in more detail are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCol\n\n\nField\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nCHROM\n\n\nChromosome name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nPOS\n\n\n1-based position. For an indel, this is the position preceding the indel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nID\n\n\nVariant identifier (optional). Usually the dbSNP rsID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nREF\n\n\nReference sequence at POS involved in the variant. For a SNP, it is a single base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nALT\n\n\nComma delimited list of alternative sequence(s) seen in our reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nQUAL\n\n\nPhred-scaled probability of all samples being homozygous reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nFILTER\n\n\nSemicolon delimited list of filters that the variant fails to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nINFO\n\n\nSemicolon delimited list of variant information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nFORMAT\n\n\nColon delimited list of the format of individual genotypes in the following fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10+\n\n\nSample(s)\n\n\nIndividual genotype information defined by FORMAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more detail on VCF files, you can look at the \nVCF format specification\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualise the variants and compare files\n\n\n\n\nOpen the VCF file in IGV using the dataset's \ndisplay in IGV local\n link (using the \nweb current\n link will open IGV again, and using \nlocal\n should use your already-running IGV). This will give an annotation track in IGV to visualise where variants have been called. Compare it to your BAM file.\n\n\nTake a look again at the same region as earlier: \nchr22:36,006,744-36,007,406\n\n\nTry comparing to the corresponding location in the pileup file. You can filter to the same window as we just opened in IGV with the tool \nFilter and Sort \n Filter\n. Choose your previously-filtered pileup file as input, and set the filter condition to \nc1==\"chr22\" and c2 \n 36006744 and c2 \n 36007406\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional: filter variants\n: See if you can work out how to filter your VCF file to variants with quality scores greater than 50. You can use the \nFilter and Sort: Filter\n tool we used above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Further steps\n\n\nWe've seen how to:\n\n\n\n\nAlign the raw data (sequence reads) to a reference genome\n\n\nGenerate variant calls from aligned reads\n\n\nInterpret the various file formats used in storing reads, alignments and variant calls\n\n\nVisualise the data using IGV\n\n\n\n\nFor real variant calling, you will probably want to carry out clean-up steps on your BAM file to improve the quality of the calls, and do further filtering and selection on the resulting variants.\n\n\nWe look at some further steps in the \nAdvanced Variant Calling\n tutorial.",

The pileup file summarises all data from the reads at each genomic region that is covered by at least one read. Each row of the pileup file gives similar information to a single vertical column of reads in the IGV view.  The current generation of variant calling tools do not output pileup files, and you don't need to do this section in order to use FreeBayes in the next section. However, a pileup file is a good illustration of the evidence the variant caller is looking at internally, and we will produce one to see this evidence.    Generate a pileup file:  From the Galaxy tools panel, select  NGS: SAMtools   Generate Pileup  \nFrom the options: \nCall consensus according to MAQ model = Yes \nThis generates a called 'consensus base' for each chromosomal position.  \nKeep other options as default and click execute   For each output file, Galaxy tries to assign a datatype attribute to every file.

This will give you all locations with a coverage of at least 10 and sufficient read quality. This is similar to the information you see when you look at IVG: each pilup row corresponds to a column of aligned bases at one genomic location.  Then, repeat the step but set  Only report variants?  to  Yes . This will effectively do variant calling: it will give you only locations that have some evidence that there might be a variant present. This variant calling is not very stringent, so you will still get lots of rows. We could filter further to, for instance, variants with high quality scores.

Select your sorted BAM file as input, and select the correct reference genome.  Under  Choose parameter selection level , select \"Simple diploid calling with filtering and coverage\". This will consider only aligned reads with sufficient mapping quality and base quality. You can see the exact parameters this sets by scrolling down in the main Galaxy window to the Galaxy FreeBayes documentation section on  Galaxy-specific options .  Execute  FreeBayes.     Check the generated list of variants .   Click the eye icon to examine the VCF file contents. The VCF format is described below - make sure you can identify the header rows and the data, and understand the important columns.  How many variants exactly are in your list? (Hint: you can look at the number of lines in the dataset, listed in the green box in the History, but remember the top lines are header lines.)  What sort of quality scores do your variants have?   FreeBayes, like most variant callers, produces a  Variant Call Format (VCF)  file.  VCF consists of a header section and a data section. The header section has some information about the file and the parameters used to produce it. The header also specifies what information is stored in the INFO, FILTER and FORMAT columns, as this is different for different variant callers.  The data section has several columns. For this tutorial, you should concentrate on CHROM, POS, REF, ALT and QUAL. CHROM and POS describe the variant's genomic location, REF and ALT describe the variant's nucleotides relative to the reference, and QUAL is a quality score giving FreeBayes' confidence in the correctness of this variant call.  The columns in more detail are:     Col  Field  Description      1  CHROM  Chromosome name    2  POS  1-based position. For an indel, this is the position preceding the indel.    3  ID  Variant identifier (optional). Usually the dbSNP rsID.    4  REF  Reference sequence at POS involved in the variant.

Only reads that have mapped to a part of chromosome 20 have been used, to make the data suitable for an interactive tutorial. There are about one million 100bp reads in the dataset, produced on an Illumina HiSeq2000.

Note that you cannot use Auto-detect for the type here as there are different subtypes of FASTQ and Galaxy can't be sure which is which.\n\n\nGet the VCF file: click \nPaste/Fetch data\n again to open a new text box, and paste the following URL into the box\n\n\nhttps://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/variantCalling_ADVNCD/dbSNP135_excludingsitesafter129_chr20.vcf\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time, you can leave the \nType\n on Auto-detect. Click \nStart\n.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the upload status for both sets of files turns \ngreen\n, you can click \nClose\n. You should now be able to see all three files in the Galaxy history panel (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Upload local data to Galaxy.\n (In most cases, you won't need this for the tutorial)\n\n\n\n\nUse this method if you have your own files to upload, or if for any reason you find you need to manually download files for the tutorial.\n\n\nIn the Galaxy tools panel (left), under \nBASIC TOOLS\n, click on \nGet Data\n and choose \nUpload File\n.\n\n\nClick \nChoose local file\n and select the downloaded  FASTQ files. Select \nType\n as \nfastqsanger\n and click \nStart\n.\n\n\nClick \nChoose local file\n again and select the downloaded VCF file. Click \nStart\n.\n\n\nOnce the upload status for all files turns \ngreen\n, you can click \nClose\n. You should now be able to see all three files in the Galaxy history panel (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the datasets\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have three files in your History, shown in the right-hand panel. If you used Method 1, the name of each dataset will be the full URL we got the file from. For convenience, we will give the datasets shorter names.\n\n\nClick on the pencil icon to the top right of the dataset name (inside the green box) for the first dataset in your History. Note that the first dataset will be at the bottom! Shorten the name (you can just delete the first part) so that it is \nNA12878.hiseq.wgs_chr20_2mb.30xPE.fastq_1\n. Click \nSave\n.\n\n\nSimilarly, rename the second dataset to \nNA12878.hiseq.wgs_chr20_2mb.30xPE.fastq_2\n.\n\n\nSimilarly, rename the third dataset to \ndbSNP135_excludingsitesafter129.chr20.vcf\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Quality Control\n\n\nThe aim here is to evaluate the quality of the short data. If the quality is poor, then adjustments can be made - eg trimming the short reads, or adjusting your expectations of the final outcome!\n\n\n\n\nAnalyse the quality of the reads in the FASTQ file.\n\n\nFrom the left hand tool panel in Galaxy, under \nNGS ANALYSIS\n, select \nNGS: QC and manipulation -\n FastQC\n\n\nSelect one of the FASTQ files as input and \nExecute\n the tool.\n\n\nWhen the tool finishes running, you should have an HTML file in your History. Click on the eye icon to view the various quality metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the generated FastQC metrics. This data looks pretty good - high per-base quality scores (most above 30).\n\n\nSection 2: Alignment and depth of coverage\n\n\nIn this step we map each of the individual reads in the sample FASTQ readsets to a reference genome, so that we will be able to identify the sequence changes with respect to the reference genome.\n\n\nSome of the variant callers need extra information regarding the source of reads in order to identify the correct error profiles to use in their statistical variant detection model, so we add more information into the alignment step so that that generated BAM file contains the metadata the variant caller expects.\n\n\nWe will also examine the depth of coverage of the aligned reads across the genome, as a quality check on both the sequencing experiment and the alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap/align the reads with Bowtie2 to the human reference genome.\n We will use Bowtie2, which is one of several good alignment tools for DNA-seq data. Under \nNGS ANALYSIS\n in the tools panel, select the tool \nNGS: Mapping -\n Bowtie2\n.\n\n\n\n\nWe have paired-end reads in two FASTQ files, so select \npaired-end\n.\n\n\nSelect the two FASTQ files as inputs.\n\n\nUnder \nSelect reference genome\n select the human genome \nhg19\n.\n\n\nNext we will add read group information. Read groups are usually used when we have reads from multiple experiments, libraries or samples, and want to put them into one aligned BAM file while remembering which read came from which group. In our case we only have one group, but the GATK tools need us to specify a read group in order to work correctly. Under \nSet read groups information?\n select \nSet read groups (SAM/BAM specification)\n. (Picard-style should also work.)\n\n\nSet the read group identifier to \"Tutorial_readgroup\". This identifier needs to be a unique identifier for this read group. Since we only have one read group, it doesn't matter much what it is, but a common practice is to construct it out of information guaranteed to be unique, such as the library identifier plus Platform Unit (e.g. flowcell) identifier.\n\n\nSet the sample name to \"NA12878\"\n\n\nSet the platform to \nILLUMINA\n\n\nSet the library name to \"Tutorial_library\". Normally we would set this to identify the DNA library from our DNA extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can leave other read group information blank, and use default Bowtie2 settings. \nExecute\n the tool.\n\n\nWhen the alignment has finished, you should rename the BAM file to something more convenient, such as \nNA12878.chr20_2mb.30xPE.bam\n.\n\n\nNote: we assume that you have seen BAM and SAM files before. If you have not you may want to try out the Basic Variant Calling workshop, or take the time now to convert your BAM file to a SAM file and examine the contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualise the aligned BAM file with IGV.\n The Integrated Genome Viewer, IGV, is a very popular tool for visualising aligned NGS data. It will run on your computer (not on the server).\n\n\n\n\nNote: if you are already familiar with IGV, you may want to go through this section quickly, but it's still a good idea to launch IGV for use in later steps.\n\n\nIn the green dataset box for your BAM file in the history panel, you will see some \ndisplay with IGV\n links. Launch IGV by clicking the \nweb current\n link. If IGV is already running on your computer, instead click the \nlocal\n link. If you have problems you can instead launch IGV by visiting https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download.\n\n\nIf\n your BAM file was not automatically loaded, download and open it:\n\n\nDownload the BAM file AND the BAM index (BAI file) by clicking the floppy-disk icon in the green dataset window and selecting each file in turn. Make sure these two files are in the same directory.\n\n\nIn IGV, select the correct reference genome, \nhg19\n, in the top-left drop-down menu.\n\n\nIn IGV, open the BAM file using \nFile -\n Load from File\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect chr20 in the IGV chromosomal region drop down box (top of IGV, on the left next to the organism drop down box).\n\n\nZoom in to the left hand end of chromosome 20 to see the read alignments - remember our reads only cover the first 2mb of the chromosome.\n\n\nScroll around and zoom in and out in the IGV genome viewer to get a feel for genomic data. Note that coverage is variable, with some regions getting almost no coverage (e.g. try chr20:1,870,686-1,880,895 - if you zoom right in to base resolution you\u2019ll see that this region is very GC rich, meaning it\u2019s hard to sequence. Unfortunately it also contains the first few exons of a gene...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestrict the genomic region considered.\n Later steps can be computationally intensive if performed on the entire genome. We will generate a genomic interval (BED) file that we will use to restrict further analyses to the first 2mb of chromosome 20, as we know our data comes from this region.\n\n\n\n\nUnder \nBASIC TOOLS\n, select the tool \nText manipulation -\n Create single interval\n. Enter these values:\n\n\nChromosome: chr20\n\n\nStart position: 0\n\n\nEnd position: 2000000\n\n\nName: chr20_2mb\n\n\nStrand: plus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute\n this tool. This will create a small BED file specifying just one genomic region.\n\n\nWhen the file is created, rename it to \nchr20_2mb.bed\n. Have a look at the contents of this BED file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate the depth of coverage of the aligned region.\n Under \nNGS COMMON TOOLSETS\n, select the tool \nNGS: GATK Tools 2.8 -\n Depth of Coverage\n.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the BAM file you just generated as the input BAM file.\n\n\nMake sure the reference genome we aligned to is selected under \nUsing reference genome\n.\n\n\nSet \nOutput format\n to \ntable\n.\n\n\nRestrict the analysis to only the region of interest: Set \nBasic or Advanced GATK options\n to \nAdvanced\n. Click \nInsert Operate on Genomic intervals\n to add a new region and select the chr20_2mb.bed file from your history.\n\n\nExecute\n.\n\n\nThis tool will produce a lot of files. We are most interested in the summaries. Examine the contents of:\n\n\n\u2018Depth of Coverage on data.... (output summary sample)\u2019:\n this file  will tell you the total depth of coverage for your sample across the genome (or in our case, across the first 2mb region we specified). It gives the total and mean coverage, plus some quantiles. This will give you an idea if there is something seriously wrong with your coverage distribution.\n\n\nYour mean depth here should be ~24x. Note that ~89% of reference bases are covered by at least 15x coverage, which is a sort of informal agreed minimum for reasonable variant calling.\n\n\nAlso have a quick look at the \n(per locus coverage)\n file. It's not practical to go through this by hand, but you'll see that it gives coverage statistics for every site in the genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other tables give you more detailed statistics on the level of coverage, broken down by regions etc. We don\u2019t really need them so to keep our Galaxy history clean you can delete all the outputs of this step except for the \u2018Depth of Coverage on data.... (output summary sample)\u2019 file. Use the \u2018X\u2019 next to a history file to delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3. Local realignment\n\n\nAlignment to large genomes is a compromise between speed and accuracy. Since we usually have (at least) millions of reads, it becomes computationally too expensive to compare reads to one another - instead, high-throughput aligners such as Bowtie align each read individually to the reference genome.\n\n\nThis is often a problem where indels are present, as the aligner will be reluctant to align a read over an indel without sufficient evidence. This can lead to misalignment and to false positive SNVs. We can improve the performance of variant callers by carrying out a further step of \u2018realignment\u2019 after the initial alignment, considering all the reads in a particular genomic region collectively. In particular, this can provide enough collective evidence to realign reads correctly over suspected indels.\n\n\nBoth GATK and FreeBayes will benefit from local realignment around indels. Some tools, such as SamTools Mpileup, have alternative methods to deal with possible misalignment around indels.\n\n\nIf you skip this section, you can still carry out the variant calling steps in later sections by simply using the BAM file from Section 2.\nHowever performing local realignment will improve the accuracy of our variant calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate the list of indel regions to be realigned.\n Under \nNGS COMMON TOOLSETS\n, select \nNGS: GATK Tools 2.8 -\n Realigner Target Creator\n. This tool will look for regions containing potential indels.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your BAM file as input.\n\n\nSelect the correct reference genome (the genome used for alignment).\n\n\nRestrict the analysis to only the region of interest: Set \nBasic or Advanced GATK options\n to \nAdvanced\n. Click \nInsert Operate on Genomic intervals\n to add a new region and select the chr20_2mb.bed file from your history.\n\n\nExecute\n.\n\n\nIf you examine the contents of the resulting intervals file, you will see a list of genomic regions to be considered in the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRealign the subsets of reads around the target indel areas.\n Under \nNGS COMMON TOOLSETS\n, select \nNGS: GATK Tools 2.8 -\n Indel Realigner\n. This step will realign reads and generate a new BAM file.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your BAM file as input.\n\n\nSelect the correct reference genome.\n\n\nUnder \nRestrict realignment to provided intervals\n, select the intervals file generated in the previous step.\n\n\nExecute\n.\n\n\nRename the file to something easier to recognise, e.g. \nNA12878.chr20_2mb.30xPE.realigned.bam\n\n\nTo keep your history clean, you may want to delete the log files generated by GATK in the last two steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the realigned BAM file to original BAM around an indel.\n\n\n\n\nOpen the realigned BAM file in IGV. You can use the \nlocal\n link to open it in your already-running IGV session and compare it to the pre-realignment BAM file.\n\n\nGenerally, the new BAM should appear identical to the old BAM except in the realigned regions.\n\n\nFind some regions with indels that have been realigned (use the \u2018Realigner Target Creator on data... (GATK intervals)\u2019 file from the first step of realignment, it has a list of the realigned regions).\n\n\nIf you can\u2019t find anything obvious, check region chr20:1163914-1163954;\nyou should see that realignment has resulted in reads originally providing evidence of a \u2018G/C\u2019 variant at chr20:1163937 to be realigned with a 10bp insertion at chr20:1163835 and no evidence of the variant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4. Calling variants with FreeBayes\n\n\nFreeBayes is a Bayesian variant caller which assesses the likelihood of each possible genotype for each position in the reference genome, given the observed reads at that position, and reports back the list of variants (positions where a genotype different to homozygous reference was called). It  can be set to aggressively call all possible variants, leaving filtering to the user. FreeBayes generates a variant quality score (as do all variant callers) which can be used for filtering. FreeBayes will also give some phasing information, indicating when nearby variants appear to be on the same chromosome.\n\n\nYou can \nread more about FreeBayes here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall variants with FreeBayes.\n Under \nNGS ANALYSIS\n, select the tool \nNGS: Variant Analysis -\n FreeBayes\n.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your realigned BAM file as input, and select the correct reference genome.\n\n\nUnder \nChoose parameter selection level\n, select \"Simple diploid calling with filtering and coverage\". This will consider only aligned reads with sufficient mapping quality and base quality. You can see the exact parameters this sets by scrolling down in the main Galaxy window to the Galaxy FreeBayes documentation section on \nGalaxy-specific options\n.\n\n\nExecute\n FreeBayes.\n\n\nWhen it has run, rename the resulting VCF file to something shorter, such as \nNA12878.FreeBayes.chr20_2mb.vcf\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the generated list of variants\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick the eye icon to examine the VCF file contents.\n\n\nHow many variants exactly are in your list? (Hint: you can look at the number of lines in the dataset, listed in the green box in the History, but remember the top lines are header lines.)\n\n\nWhat sort of quality scores do your variants have?\n\n\nOpen the VCF file in IGV using the dataset's \ndisplay in IGV local\n link (using the \nweb current\n link will open IGV again, and using \nlocal\n should use your already-running IGV). This will give an annotation track in IGV to visualise where variants have been called. Compare it to your BAM file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 5. Calling variants with GATK Unified Genotyper\n\n\nFor comparison, we will call variants with a second variant caller.\n\n\nThe GATK (genome analysis toolkit) is a set of tools from the Broad Institute. It includes the tools for local realignment, used in the previous step.\n\n\nThe GATK UnifiedGenotyper is a Bayesian variant caller and genotyper. You can also use the GATK HaplotypeCaller, which should be available on the GVL server you are using. It takes a little longer to run but is a more recent and sophisticated variant caller that takes into account human haplotype information. Both of these tools are intended primarily for calling diploid, germline variants.\n\n\nYou can \nread more about the GATK here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall variants using Unified Genotyper.\n Under \nNGS COMMON TOOLSETS\n, select the tool \nNGS: GATK Tools 2.8 -\n Unified Genotyper\n.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your realigned BAM file as input, and select the correct reference genome.\n\n\nUnifiedGenotyper can automatically label called variants that correspond to known human SNPs, if we provide it with a list of these. We have a VCF file of known SNPs which you imported as input data for this workshop. Under \ndbSNP ROD file\n, select the dataset \ndbsnp135_excludingsitesafter129_chr20.vcf\n.\n\n\nSet \nGenotype likelihoods calculation model to employ\n to \nSNP\n.\n\n\nRestrict the analysis to only the region of interest: Set \nBasic or Advanced GATK options\n to \nAdvanced\n. Click \nInsert Operate on Genomic intervals\n to add a new region and select the chr20_2mb.bed file from your history.\n\n\nExecute\n.\n\n\nRename the file to something useful eg \nNA12878.GATK.chr20_2mb.vcf\n.\n\n\nThe output file of interest is the VCF file. If you like, clean up your History by deleting the (log) and (metrics) files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the generated list of variants.\n\n\n\n\nRoughly how many variants are there in your VCF file (how many lines in the dataset?)\n\n\nClick the eye icon to examine the contents of the VCF file. Notice that the \nID\n column (the third column) is populated with known SNP IDs from the VCF file we provided.\n\n\nNotice that the VCF header rows, and the corresponding information in the \nINFO\n column, is NOT the same as for the VCF file generated by FreeBayes. In general each variant caller gets to decide what information to put in the \nINFO\n column, so long as it adds header rows to describe the fields it uses.\n\n\nOpen the VCF file in IGV, using the link in the history panel.\n\n\nFind a region where GATK has called a variant but FreeBayes hasn\u2019t, and vice versa. Try chr20:1,123,714-1,128,378.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6. Evaluate variants\n\n\nHow can we evaluate our variants?\n\n\nWe've called variants on normal human DNA, so we expect to find variants with the typical characteristics of human germline variants. We know a lot about variation in humans from many empirical studies, including the 1000Genomes project, so we have some expectations on what we should see when we call variants in a new sample:\n\n\n\n\nWe expect to see true variations at the rate of about 1 per 1000bp against the reference genome\n\n\n85% of variations \u2018rediscovered\u2019 - that is, 85% already known and recorded in dbSNP (% dependent on the version of dbSNP)\n\n\nA transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) rate of \n2 if the variants are high quality, even higher if the variants are in coding regions.\n\n\n\n\nYou can \nread more about SNP call set properties here\n.\n\n\nYou may find that each of the variant callers has more variants than we would have expected - we would have expected around 2000 in our 2 megabase region but we see between 3000 and 5000. This is normal for variant calling, where most callers err on the side of sensitivity to reduce false negatives (missed SNVs), expecting the user to do further filtering to remove false positives (false SNVs).\n\n\nWe will also compare the output of our variant callers to one another - how many SNVs have they called in common? How many do they disagree on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate dbSNP concordance and Ti/Tv ratio using the GATK VariantEval tool.\n\n\n\n\nUnder \nNGS COMMON TOOLSETS\n, select \nNGS: GATK Tools 2.8 -\n Eval Variants\n.\n\n\nUnder \nInput variant file\n, select the VCF file you generated with FreeBayes.\n\n\nClick \nInsert Variant\n to add a second input file, and under \nInput variant file\n, select the VCF file you generated with UnifiedGenotyper.\n\n\nSet the reference genome to \nhg19\n.\n\n\nProvide our list of known variants: make sure \nProvide a dbSNP Reference-Ordered Data (ROD) file\n is set to \nSet dbSNP\n and under \ndbSNP ROD file\n select the input reference variant file, \ndbSNP135_excludingsitesafter129.chr20.vcf\n.\n\n\nWe will avoid carrying out the full suite of comparisons for this tutorial, and look at a couple of metrics. Set \nBasic or Advanced Analysis options\n to \nAdvanced\n. Then set the following:\n\n\nEval modules to apply on the eval track(s)\n:\n\n\nCompOverlap\n\n\nTiTvVariantEvaluator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not use the standard eval modules by default\n: check this option\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpret the dbSNP concordance section of the evaluation report.\n\n\n\n\nExamine the contents of the \u2018Eval Variants on data... (report)\u2019\n\n\nThe first section of the report lists the overlap in variants between the generated VCF files and known human variation sites from dbSNP.\n\n\nThe \nEvalRod\n column specifies which of the input VCFs is analysed (input_0 = first VCF, input_1 = second etc). For us, these should be FreeBayes and GATK respectively.\n\n\nThe \nCompRod\n column specifies the set of variants against which the input VCFs are being compared; we have used dbsnp.\n\n\nNovelty\n: whether the variants in this row have been found in the supplied dbSNP file or not (known = in dbSNP, novel = not in dbSNP). The rows containing \nall\n variants are the most informative summaries.\n\n\nnEvalVariants\n: number of variant sites in EvalRod (i.e. all called variants).\n\n\nnovelSites\n: number of variant sites found in EvalRod but not CompRod (i.e. called variants not in dbSNP).\n\n\nCompOverlap\n: number of variant sites found in both EvalRod and CompRod (i.e. called variants that ARE in dbSNP).\n\n\ncompRate\n: percentage of variant sites from EvalRod found in CompRod (=CompOverlap/nEvalVariants).\n\n\nThis metric is important, and it\u2019s what people generally refer to as \ndbSNP concordance\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnConcordant\n and \nconcordantRate\n: number and percentage of overlapping variants that have the same genotype.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpret the TiTv section of the evaluation report.\n\n\n\n\nThe second section of the report lists the transition/transversion ratio for different groups of variants from the callsets.\n\n\nIt generally follows the table format above. The most interesting metric is in the column labelled \ntiTvRatio\n.\n\n\nThe expectation is a Ti/Tv close to the TiTvRatioStandard of 2.38. Generally, the higher the better, as a high Ti/Tv ratio indicates that most variants are likely to reflect our expectations from what we know about human variation.\n\n\nIn this table, it can be useful to compare not just the rows labelled \nall\n, but also those labelled \nknown\n and \nnovel\n. Is the Ti/Tv ratio different for known dbSNP variants, as compared to novel variants in this individual?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much overlap is there in the call sets?\n\n\n\n\nOne way to work out how many of the variants are in common between the call sets is to produce a Venn diagram to visualise the overlap. Since all our variants are on chromosome 20, we will do this by simply comparing the positions of the SNVs. So, we will first remove the VCF headers, leaving us just the variant rows, and then we will compare the variant coordinates.\n\n\nRemove the header lines from a VCF file: select the tool \nBASIC TOOLS -\n Filter and Sort -\nSelect\n.\n\n\nAs an input file, in \nSelect lines from\n, select the VCF file you generated using FreeBayes.\n\n\nSelect \nNOT Matching\n.\n\n\nAs the pattern, enter \"^#\". \n^\n in regular expressions indicates the start of the line, so this is a regular expression that says we are detecting lines where there is a \"#\" character at the start of the line.\n\n\nExecute\n. This should give you a new dataset, containing just the variant rows. Notice that the number of lines in this dataset now tells you how many variant calls you have!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the above steps to remove the header lines from VCF file that you generated using GATK UnifiedGenotyper.\n\n\nCreate a Venn diagram: select the tool \nSTATISTICS AND VISUALISATION -\n Graph/Display Data -\n proportional venn\n.\n\n\nEnter any title you like, e.g. \"FreeBayes vs UnifiedGenotyper\".\n\n\nAs \nInput file 1\n, select the first of the filtered files you just generated.\n\n\nAs \nColumn index\n, enter 1. This is the second column, i.e. the column containing the position coordinate.\n\n\nUnder \nas name\n, enter a name for this input file, e.g. just \"FreeBayes\".\n\n\nAs \nInput file 2\n, select the second of the filtered VCF files.\n\n\nAgain as \nColumn index\n, enter 1.\n\n\nUnder \nas name\n, enter a name for this input file, e.g. just \"UnifiedGenotyper\".\n\n\nExecute\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should get an HTML file containing a Venn diagram, containing the overlap of the two sets of SNV calls. The counts below show how many variants are in each part of the diagram:\n\n\n\"FreeBayes \\ UnifiedGenotyper\" indicates the difference, i.e. how many variants were called by FreeBayes and \nnot\n UnifiedGenotyper.\n\n\n\"FreeBayes \u2229 UnifiedGenotyper\" indicates the intersection, i.e. how many variants were called by both variant callers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will probably find that FreeBayes calls variants more aggressively, and that there are more variants called by FreeBayes and not UnifiedGenotyper than vice versa. We could make FreeBayes calls more specific by filtering on e.g. variant quality score. We'd expect this to  remove many false positives, but also a few true positives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 7. Annotation\n\n\nThe variants we have detected can be annotated with information from known reference data. This can include, for instance\n\n\n\n\nwhether the variant corresponds to a previously-observed variant in other samples, or across the population\n\n\nwhether the variant is inside or near a known gene\n\n\nwhether the variant is in a particular kind of genomic region (exon of a gene, UTR, etc)\n\n\nwhether a variant is at a site predicted to cause a pathogenic effect on the gene when mutated\n\n\n\n\n... and lots of other information!\n\n\nMost human genes have multiple isoforms, i.e. multiple alternative splicings leading to alternative transcripts. The annotation information we get for a variant in the gene can depend on which transcript is used. In some cases, unless you request only one, you may see multiple alternative annotations for one variant.\n\n\nFor this workshop we will annotate our variants with the \nSnpEff\n tool, which has its own prebuilt annotation databases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotate the detected variants.\n Select the tool \nNGS ANALYSIS -\n NGS: Annotation -\n SnpEff\n.\n\n\n\n\nChoose any of your generated lists of variants as the input VCF file in the first field.\n\n\nSelect \nVCF\n as the output format as well. This will add the annotated information to the INFO column of the VCF file.\n\n\nAs \nGenome source\n, select \nNamed on demand\n. Then as the genome, enter \"hg19\". This should work on any server, even if the SnpEff annotation database for hg19 has not been previously installed.\n\n\nMake sure \nProduce Summary Stats\n is set to \nYes\n.\n\n\nExecute\n SnpEff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the annotated information.\n Click the eye icon on the resulting VCF file to view it.\n\n\n\n\nYou should see more information in the INFO column for each variant.\n\n\nYou should also see a few extra VCF header rows. In particular notice the new \nINFO=\nID=EFF...\n header row, listing the information added on the predicted effects of each variant.\n\n\nHave a look through a few variants. Variants not inside or near known genes will not have much annotated information, and may simply have a short \nEFF\n field listing the variant as being in an \"intergenic region\". Variants in known functional regions of the genome will be annotated with much more information.\n\n\nTry filtering to view only missense variants (i.e. substitutions which cause an amino acid change) by using the Galaxy tool \nBASIC TOOLS -\n Filter and Sort -\n Select\n on your annotated VCF file and filtering for lines matching the string \"missense_variant\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the annotation summary stats.\n The other file SnpEff produces is an HTML document with a summary of the annotations applied to the observed variants. Examine the contents of this file.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see summaries of types of variants, impact of variants, functional regions etc.\n Go through these tables and graphs and see if you understand what they represent.\n\n\nWhere are most of the variants found (in exons, introns etc)? Does this match what you'd expect?",

            "text": "In this step we map each of the individual reads in the sample FASTQ readsets to a reference genome, so that we will be able to identify the sequence changes with respect to the reference genome.  Some of the variant callers need extra information regarding the source of reads in order to identify the correct error profiles to use in their statistical variant detection model, so we add more information into the alignment step so that that generated BAM file contains the metadata the variant caller expects.  We will also examine the depth of coverage of the aligned reads across the genome, as a quality check on both the sequencing experiment and the alignment.    Map/align the reads with Bowtie2 to the human reference genome.  We will use Bowtie2, which is one of several good alignment tools for DNA-seq data. Under  NGS ANALYSIS  in the tools panel, select the tool  NGS: Mapping -  Bowtie2 .   We have paired-end reads in two FASTQ files, so select  paired-end .  Select the two FASTQ files as inputs.  Under  Select reference genome  select the human genome  hg19 .  Next we will add read group information. Read groups are usually used when we have reads from multiple experiments, libraries or samples, and want to put them into one aligned BAM file while remembering which read came from which group. In our case we only have one group, but the GATK tools need us to specify a read group in order to work correctly. Under  Set read groups information?  select  Set read groups (SAM/BAM specification) . (Picard-style should also work.)  Set the read group identifier to \"Tutorial_readgroup\". This identifier needs to be a unique identifier for this read group. Since we only have one read group, it doesn't matter much what it is, but a common practice is to construct it out of information guaranteed to be unique, such as the library identifier plus Platform Unit (e.g. flowcell) identifier.  Set the sample name to \"NA12878\"  Set the platform to  ILLUMINA  Set the library name to \"Tutorial_library\". Normally we would set this to identify the DNA library from our DNA extraction.    You can leave other read group information blank, and use default Bowtie2 settings.  Execute  the tool.  When the alignment has finished, you should rename the BAM file to something more convenient, such as  NA12878.chr20_2mb.30xPE.bam .  Note: we assume that you have seen BAM and SAM files before. If you have not you may want to try out the Basic Variant Calling workshop, or take the time now to convert your BAM file to a SAM file and examine the contents.     Visualise the aligned BAM file with IGV.  The Integrated Genome Viewer, IGV, is a very popular tool for visualising aligned NGS data. It will run on your computer (not on the server).   Note: if you are already familiar with IGV, you may want to go through this section quickly, but it's still a good idea to launch IGV for use in later steps.  In the green dataset box for your BAM file in the history panel, you will see some  display with IGV  links. Launch IGV by clicking the  web current  link. If IGV is already running on your computer, instead click the  local  link. If you have problems you can instead launch IGV by visiting https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download.  If  your BAM file was not automatically loaded, download and open it:  Download the BAM file AND the BAM index (BAI file) by clicking the floppy-disk icon in the green dataset window and selecting each file in turn. Make sure these two files are in the same directory.  In IGV, select the correct reference genome,  hg19 , in the top-left drop-down menu.  In IGV, open the BAM file using  File -  Load from File .    Select chr20 in the IGV chromosomal region drop down box (top of IGV, on the left next to the organism drop down box).  Zoom in to the left hand end of chromosome 20 to see the read alignments - remember our reads only cover the first 2mb of the chromosome.  Scroll around and zoom in and out in the IGV genome viewer to get a feel for genomic data. Note that coverage is variable, with some regions getting almost no coverage (e.g. try chr20:1,870,686-1,880,895 - if you zoom right in to base resolution you\u2019ll see that this region is very GC rich, meaning it\u2019s hard to sequence. Unfortunately it also contains the first few exons of a gene...)     Restrict the genomic region considered.  Later steps can be computationally intensive if performed on the entire genome. We will generate a genomic interval (BED) file that we will use to restrict further analyses to the first 2mb of chromosome 20, as we know our data comes from this region.   Under  BASIC TOOLS , select the tool  Text manipulation -  Create single interval . Enter these values:  Chromosome: chr20  Start position: 0  End position: 2000000  Name: chr20_2mb  Strand: plus    Execute  this tool. This will create a small BED file specifying just one genomic region.  When the file is created, rename it to  chr20_2mb.bed . Have a look at the contents of this BED file.     Evaluate the depth of coverage of the aligned region.  Under  NGS COMMON TOOLSETS , select the tool  NGS: GATK Tools 2.8 -  Depth of Coverage .   Select the BAM file you just generated as the input BAM file.  Make sure the reference genome we aligned to is selected under  Using reference genome .  Set  Output format  to  table .  Restrict the analysis to only the region of interest: Set  Basic or Advanced GATK options  to  Advanced . Click  Insert Operate on Genomic intervals  to add a new region and select the chr20_2mb.bed file from your history.  Execute .  This tool will produce a lot of files. We are most interested in the summaries. Examine the contents of:  \u2018Depth of Coverage on data.... (output summary sample)\u2019:  this file  will tell you the total depth of coverage for your sample across the genome (or in our case, across the first 2mb region we specified). It gives the total and mean coverage, plus some quantiles. This will give you an idea if there is something seriously wrong with your coverage distribution.  Your mean depth here should be ~24x. Note that ~89% of reference bases are covered by at least 15x coverage, which is a sort of informal agreed minimum for reasonable variant calling.  Also have a quick look at the  (per locus coverage)  file. It's not practical to go through this by hand, but you'll see that it gives coverage statistics for every site in the genome.    The other tables give you more detailed statistics on the level of coverage, broken down by regions etc. We don\u2019t really need them so to keep our Galaxy history clean you can delete all the outputs of this step except for the \u2018Depth of Coverage on data....

Since we usually have (at least) millions of reads, it becomes computationally too expensive to compare reads to one another - instead, high-throughput aligners such as Bowtie align each read individually to the reference genome.  This is often a problem where indels are present, as the aligner will be reluctant to align a read over an indel without sufficient evidence. This can lead to misalignment and to false positive SNVs. We can improve the performance of variant callers by carrying out a further step of \u2018realignment\u2019 after the initial alignment, considering all the reads in a particular genomic region collectively. In particular, this can provide enough collective evidence to realign reads correctly over suspected indels.  Both GATK and FreeBayes will benefit from local realignment around indels. Some tools, such as SamTools Mpileup, have alternative methods to deal with possible misalignment around indels.  If you skip this section, you can still carry out the variant calling steps in later sections by simply using the BAM file from Section 2.\nHowever performing local realignment will improve the accuracy of our variant calls.

Compare the realigned BAM file to original BAM around an indel.   Open the realigned BAM file in IGV. You can use the  local  link to open it in your already-running IGV session and compare it to the pre-realignment BAM file.

We know a lot about variation in humans from many empirical studies, including the 1000Genomes project, so we have some expectations on what we should see when we call variants in a new sample:   We expect to see true variations at the rate of about 1 per 1000bp against the reference genome  85% of variations \u2018rediscovered\u2019 - that is, 85% already known and recorded in dbSNP (% dependent on the version of dbSNP)  A transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) rate of  2 if the variants are high quality, even higher if the variants are in coding regions.   You can  read more about SNP call set properties here .  You may find that each of the variant callers has more variants than we would have expected - we would have expected around 2000 in our 2 megabase region but we see between 3000 and 5000. This is normal for variant calling, where most callers err on the side of sensitivity to reduce false negatives (missed SNVs), expecting the user to do further filtering to remove false positives (false SNVs).  We will also compare the output of our variant callers to one another - how many SNVs have they called in common? How many do they disagree on?    Evaluate dbSNP concordance and Ti/Tv ratio using the GATK VariantEval tool.   Under  NGS COMMON TOOLSETS , select  NGS: GATK Tools 2.8 -  Eval Variants .  Under  Input variant file , select the VCF file you generated with FreeBayes.  Click  Insert Variant  to add a second input file, and under  Input variant file , select the VCF file you generated with UnifiedGenotyper.  Set the reference genome to  hg19 .

We will avoid carrying out the full suite of comparisons for this tutorial, and look at a couple of metrics. Set  Basic or Advanced Analysis options  to  Advanced . Then set the following:  Eval modules to apply on the eval track(s) :  CompOverlap  TiTvVariantEvaluator    Do not use the standard eval modules by default : check this option    Execute .     Interpret the dbSNP concordance section of the evaluation report.   Examine the contents of the \u2018Eval Variants on data... (report)\u2019  The first section of the report lists the overlap in variants between the generated VCF files and known human variation sites from dbSNP.  The  EvalRod  column specifies which of the input VCFs is analysed (input_0 = first VCF, input_1 = second etc). For us, these should be FreeBayes and GATK respectively.  The  CompRod  column specifies the set of variants against which the input VCFs are being compared; we have used dbsnp.  Novelty : whether the variants in this row have been found in the supplied dbSNP file or not (known = in dbSNP, novel = not in dbSNP). The rows containing  all  variants are the most informative summaries.  nEvalVariants : number of variant sites in EvalRod (i.e. all called variants).  novelSites : number of variant sites found in EvalRod but not CompRod (i.e. called variants not in dbSNP).  CompOverlap : number of variant sites found in both EvalRod and CompRod (i.e. called variants that ARE in dbSNP).  compRate : percentage of variant sites from EvalRod found in CompRod (=CompOverlap/nEvalVariants).  This metric is important, and it\u2019s what people generally refer to as  dbSNP concordance .    nConcordant  and  concordantRate : number and percentage of overlapping variants that have the same genotype.       Interpret the TiTv section of the evaluation report.   The second section of the report lists the transition/transversion ratio for different groups of variants from the callsets.  It generally follows the table format above. The most interesting metric is in the column labelled  tiTvRatio .  The expectation is a Ti/Tv close to the TiTvRatioStandard of 2.38. Generally, the higher the better, as a high Ti/Tv ratio indicates that most variants are likely to reflect our expectations from what we know about human variation.  In this table, it can be useful to compare not just the rows labelled  all , but also those labelled  known  and  novel . Is the Ti/Tv ratio different for known dbSNP variants, as compared to novel variants in this individual?     How much overlap is there in the call sets?   One way to work out how many of the variants are in common between the call sets is to produce a Venn diagram to visualise the overlap. Since all our variants are on chromosome 20, we will do this by simply comparing the positions of the SNVs. So, we will first remove the VCF headers, leaving us just the variant rows, and then we will compare the variant coordinates.  Remove the header lines from a VCF file: select the tool  BASIC TOOLS -  Filter and Sort - Select .  As an input file, in  Select lines from , select the VCF file you generated using FreeBayes.  Select  NOT Matching .  As the pattern, enter \"^#\".  ^  in regular expressions indicates the start of the line, so this is a regular expression that says we are detecting lines where there is a \"#\" character at the start of the line.  Execute . This should give you a new dataset, containing just the variant rows. Notice that the number of lines in this dataset now tells you how many variant calls you have!    Repeat the above steps to remove the header lines from VCF file that you generated using GATK UnifiedGenotyper.  Create a Venn diagram: select the tool  STATISTICS AND VISUALISATION -  Graph/Display Data -  proportional venn .  Enter any title you like, e.g. \"FreeBayes vs UnifiedGenotyper\".  As  Input file 1 , select the first of the filtered files you just generated.  As  Column index , enter 1. This is the second column, i.e. the column containing the position coordinate.  Under  as name , enter a name for this input file, e.g. just \"FreeBayes\".  As  Input file 2 , select the second of the filtered VCF files.  Again as  Column index , enter 1.  Under  as name , enter a name for this input file, e.g. just \"UnifiedGenotyper\".  Execute .    You should get an HTML file containing a Venn diagram, containing the overlap of the two sets of SNV calls. The counts below show how many variants are in each part of the diagram:  \"FreeBayes \\ UnifiedGenotyper\" indicates the difference, i.e. how many variants were called by FreeBayes and  not  UnifiedGenotyper.  \"FreeBayes \u2229 UnifiedGenotyper\" indicates the intersection, i.e. how many variants were called by both variant callers.    You will probably find that FreeBayes calls variants more aggressively, and that there are more variants called by FreeBayes and not UnifiedGenotyper than vice versa. We could make FreeBayes calls more specific by filtering on e.g. variant quality score. We'd expect this to  remove many false positives, but also a few true positives.",

In haploid organisms variant calling and genotyping are equivalent whereas the same rule does not apply to other organisms.\n\n\nVariant callers estimate the probability of a particular genotype given the observed data.\n\n\nThe question one would be asking is what possible genotypes would be possible for a sample. The remaining question is, given that our variant calling process calls a variant, does that mean that there is truly a variant in this locus and also given that the variant caller doesn\u2019t detect a variant in a position does that mean there is no variant in that position.\n\n\nThe result of variant calling is a list of probable variants.\n\n\nProcess of variant calling\n\n\nSample DNA -\n Sequencing -\n Read alignment -\n BAM file of aligned reads against reference genome -\n Genotyper -\n Variant list\n\n\nThe number of reads that stack up on each other is called \nread coverage\n. The data is converted into positional information of the reference with the read counts that have piled up under each position. Variant calling will look at how many bases out of the total number of bases is different to the reference at any position.\n\n\nHomozygous or Heterozygous mutations:\n\n\nWhat should be noted about variants is that they are rare events and homozygous variants are even rarer than heterozygous events.\n\n\nVariant Calling Software:\n\n\nThere a number of software available for variant calling some of which are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSAMtools (mpileup and bcftools): Li 2009 Bioinformatics\n\n\nGATK: McKenna et al. 2010 Genome Res\n\n\nFreeBayes: MIT\n\n\nDiBayes: SOLiD software http://www.lifetechnologies.com\n\n\nInGAP: Qi J, Zhao F, Buboltz A, Schuster SC.. 2009. \nBioinformatics\n\n\nMAQGene: Bigelow H, Doitsidou M, Sarin S, Hobert O. 2009. \nNature Methods\n\n\n\n\nVariant Calling using Samtools (Mpileup + bcftools)\n\n\nSamtools calculates the genotype likelihoods. We then pipe the output to bcftools, which does our SNP calling based on those likelihoods.\n\n\nMpileup: Input: BAM file Output: Pileuped up reads under the reference\n\n\nbcftools: Input: Pileup output from Mpileup Output: VCF file with sites and genotypes\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVariant Calling using GATK-Unified Genotyper\n\n\nGATK is a programming framework based on the philosophy of MapReduce for developing NGS tools in a distributed or shared memory parallelized form.\n\n\nGATK unified genotyper uses a Bayesian probabilistic model to calculate genotype likelihoods.\n\n\nInputs: BAM file\n\n\nOutput: VCF file with sites and genotypes.\n\n\nThe probability of a variant genotype for a given sequence of data is calculated using the \nBayes Theorem\n as follows:\n\n\nP(Genotype | Data) =  (P(Data | Genotype) * P(Genotype)) / P(Data)\n\n\n\n\nP(Genotype) is the overall probability of that genotype being present in a sequence. This is called the prior probability of a Genotype.\n\n\nP(Data | Genotype) is the probability of the data (the reads) given the genotype\n\n\nP(Data) is the probability of seeing the reads.\n\n\nGATK unified genotyper is not very good in dealing with INDELs and thus we would only calculate SNPs throughout this tutorial. GATK is setup to work with diploid genomes but can be used on haploids as well.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVariant Calling using FreeBayes\n\n\nFreeBayes is a high performance, flexible variant caller which uses the open source Freebayes tool to detect genetic variations based high throughput sequencing data (BAM files).\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nEvaluation of detected variants using Variant Eval\n\n\nThe identified variation can further be evaluated against known variations such as common dbSNPs. The result can be checked for high concordance to the common SNPs or a known set of SNPs, the truth set.\n\n\nThe results will have:\n\n\n\n\nTrue Positives (TP): The variants called by the software which are also a known variant in the known variants file.\n\n\nFalse Positives (FP): The Variants called by the software which are not known to be variants in the known variants file.\n\n\nTrue Negatives (TN): The variants not called by the software which are not known to be variants in the known variants file.\n\n\nFalse Negatives (FN): The variants not called by the software which are known as variants in the known variants file.\n\n\n\n\nQuality Matrix:\n\n\nTP | FP\n---|----\nTN | FN\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity: TP/(TP+FN)\n\n\nSpecificity: TN/(TN+FP)\n\n\nNote:\n\n\nAlthough software methods available can find variants in unique regions reliably, the short NGS read length prevent them from detecting variations in repetitive regions with comparable sensitivity.\n\n\nDNA substitution mutations are of two types: Transitions and Transversions. The Ti/Tv ratio (Transitions/Transversions) is also an indicator of how well the model has performed for genotyping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransition: a point mutation in which a purine nucleotide is changed to another purine nucleotide. (A\\\n->G) or a pyrimidine nucleotide to another pyrimidine. Approximately 2 out of 3 SNPs are Transitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransversion: a substitute of a purine for a pyrimidine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are twice as many Transversions as there are Transitions because of the molecular mechanisms by which they are generated, Transition mutations occur at the higher rate than the Transversion mutations.\n\n\nFor more details on variant eval visit: \nhttp://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/gatkdocs/org_broadinstitute_sting_gatk_walkers_varianteval_VariantEval.html\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\nAn important thing worth noting is the more data the better the variant calling. In addition multisampling improves performance.\n\n\nLocal realignment\n\n\nIn order to call SNPs close by INDELs correctly, local realignment is strongly recommended before variant calling when using both UnifiedGenotyper and FreeBayes. Samtools mpileup output would not however be affected since it works around this by introducing Base Alignment Quality (BAC). For more information on BAC refer to: \nhttp://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml\n\n\nThe Galaxy workflow platform\n\n\nGalaxy is an online bioinformatics workflow management system. Essentially, you upload your files, create various analysis pipelines and run them, then visualise your results.\n\n\nGalaxy is really an interface to the various tools that do the data processing; each of these tools could be run from the command line, outside of Galaxy. Galaxy makes it easier to link up the tools together and visualise the entire analysis pipeline.\n\n\nGalaxy uses the concept of 'histories'. Histories are sets of data and workflows that act on that data. The data for this workshop is available in a shared history, which you can import into your own Galaxy account\n\n\nLearn more about Galaxy here\n\n\nThe Galaxy interface. Tools on the left, data in the middle, analysis workflow on the right.\n\n\n\n\nData Format used in the tutorial\n\n\nSequence Alignment Map format\n\n\nSAM format\n\n\nSequence Alignment/Map format records all information relevant to how a set of reads aligns to a reference genome. A SAM file has an optional set of header lines describing the context of the alignment, then one line per read, with the following format:\n\n\n\n\n11 mandatory fields (+ variable number of optional fields)\n\n\n1 QNAME: Query name of the read\n\n\n2 FLAG\n\n\n3 RNAME: Reference sequence name\n\n\n4 POS: Position of alignment in reference sequence\n\n\n5 MAPQ: Mapping quality (Phred-scaled)\n\n\n6 CIGAR: String that describes the specifics of the alignment against the reference\n\n\n7 MRNM\n\n\n8 MPOS\n\n\n9 ISIZE\n\n\n10 SEQQuery: Sequence on the same strand as the reference\n\n\n11 QUAL: Query quality (ASCII-33=Phred base quality)\n\n\n\n\nSAM example\n\n\n    SRR017937.312 16 chr20 43108717 37 76M * 0 0\n    TGAGCCTCCGGGCTATGTGTGCTCACTGACAGAAGACCTGGTCACCAAAGCCCGGGAAGAGCTGCAGGAAAAGCCG\n    ?,@A=A\\\n5=,@==A:BB@=B9(.;A@B;\\\n@ABBB@@9BB@:@5\\\nBBBB9)\\\nBBB2\\\nBBB@BBB?;;BABBBBBBB@\n\n\n\n\nFor this example:\n\n\n\n\nQNAME = SRR017937.312\n - this is the name of this read\n\n\nFLAG = 16\n - see the format description below\n\n\nRNAME = chr20\n - this read aligns to chromosome 20\n\n\nPOS = 43108717\n - this read aligns the sequence on chr20 at position 43108717\n\n\nMAPQ = 37\n - this is quite a high quality score for the alignment (b/w 0 and 90)\n\n\nCIGAR = 76M\n - this read aligns to the reference segment across all bases (76 Matches means no deletions or insertions. Note that 'aligns' can mean 'aligns with mismatches' - mismatches that don't affect the alignment are not recorded in this field)\n\n\nMRNM = *\n - see the format description below\n\n\nMPOS = 0\n as there is no mate for this read - the sequenced DNA library was single ended, not mate paired*.\n\n\nISIZE = 0\n as there is no mate for this read\n\n\nSEQQuery =\n the 76bp sequence of the reference segment\n\n\nQUAL =\n per-base quality scores for each position on the alignment. This is just a copy of what is in the FASTQ file\n\n\n\n\nSAM\n format is described more fully \nhere\n\n\nNOTE: reads are shown mapped to the \"sense\" strand of the reference, and bases are listed in 5' -> 3' order. This is important because an actual read might be from the other strand of DNA. The alignment tool will try to map the read as it is, and also the reverse compliment. If it was on the other strand then the reverse compliment is shown in the SAM file, rather than the original read itself\n\n\nSee\nhttp://www.illumina.com/technology/paired_end_sequencing_assay.ilmn\n for an overview of paired-end sequencing.\n\n\nSAM file in Galaxy\n\n\n\n\nBinary Sequence Alignment Map format\n\n\nBAM format\n\n\nSAM is a text format which is not space efficient. Binary Sequence Alignment is a compressed version of SAM.\n\n\nData in a BAM file is binary and therefore can't be visualised as text. If you try and visualise in Galaxy, it will default to downloading the file\n\n\nBAM file in IGV\n\n\n\n\nVCF file format\n\n\nWhat is VCF file:\n\n\nThe \nVariant Call Format\n (VCF) is the emerging standard for storing variant data. Originally designed for SNPs and short INDELs, it also works for structural variations.\n\n\nVCF consists of a header section and a data section. The header must contain a line starting with one '#', showing the name of each field, and then the sample names starting at the 10th column. The data section is TAB delimited with each line consisting of at least 8 mandatory fields (the first 8 fields in the table below). The FORMAT field and sample information are allowed to be absent. We refer to the official \nVCF spec\n for a more rigorous description of the format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCol\n\n\nField\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nCHROM\n\n\nChromosome name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nPOS\n\n\n1-based position. For an indel, this is the position preceding the indel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nID\n\n\nVariant identifier. Usually the dbSNP rsID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nREF\n\n\nReference sequence at POS involved in the variant. For a SNP, it is a single base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nALT\n\n\nComma delimited list of alternative sequence(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nQUAL\n\n\nPhred-scaled probability of all samples being homozygous reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nFILTER\n\n\nSemicolon delimited list of filters that the variant fails to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nINFO\n\n\nSemicolon delimited list of variant information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nFORMAT\n\n\nColon delimited list of the format of individual genotypes in the following fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10+\n\n\nSample(s)\n\n\nIndividual genotype information defined by FORMAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVCF format in Galaxy:\n\n\n\n\nBcf file format:\n\n\n\n\nBCF format:\n\n\nBCF, or the binary variant call format, is the binary version of VCF. It keeps the same information in VCF, while much more efficient to process especially for many samples. The relationship between BCF and VCF is similar to that between BAM and SAM.",

In practice, real datasets would be much larger and\ncontain sequencing and alignment errors that make analysis more difficult.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we will:  \n\n\n\n\nintroduce the types of files typically used in RNA-seq analysis\n\n\nalign RNA-seq reads with an aligner (HISAT2)\n\n\nvisualise RNA-seq alignment data with IGV\n\n\nuse a number of different methods to find differentially expressed genes\n\n\nunderstand the importance of replicates for differential expression analysis\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial does not cover the following steps that might do in a real\nRNA-seq DGE analysis:  \n\n\n\n\nQC (quality control) of the raw sequence data\n\n\nTrimming the reads for quality and for adaptor sequences\n\n\nQC of the RNA-seq alignment data  \n\n\n\n\nThese steps have been omitted because the data we use in this tutorial is\nsynthetic and has no quality issues, unlike real data.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial you should:\n\n\n\n\nBe familiar with basic workflow of alignment, quantification, and testing,\n   for RNA-seq differential expression analysis\n\n\nBe able to process raw RNA sequence data into a list of differentially\n   expressed genes\n\n\nBe aware of how the relationship between the number of biological replicates\n   in an experiment and the statistical power available to detect differentially\n   expressed genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data\n\n\nThe sequencing data you will be working with is simulated from Drosophila\nmelanogaster. The experiment has two conditioins, WT (wildtype) and KO\n(knockout), and three samples in each condition. The sequencing data is\npaired-end, so there are two files for each of the six samples. Your aim will\nbe to find differentially expressed genes in WT vs KO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Preparation\n\n\n1.  Register as a new user in Galaxy if you don\u2019t already have an account\n\n\n\n\nOpen a browser and go to a Galaxy server. This can either be your\n    personal GVL server you \nstarted previously\n,\n    the public \nGalaxy Tutorial server\n\n    or the public \nGalaxy Melbourne server\n.\n\n    Recommended browsers include Firefox and Chrome. Internet Explorer\n    is not supported.\n\n\nRegister as a new user by clicking \nUser \n Register\n on the top\n    dark-grey bar.

Import the RNA-seq data for the workshop.\n\n\nIf you are using the public Galaxy Tutorial server or Galaxy Melbourne server,\nyou can import the data directly from Galaxy. You can do this by going to\n\nShared Data \n Published Histories\n on the top toolbar, and selecting\nthe history called \nRNA-Seq_Basic_2017\n. Then click on \"Import History\" on\nthe top right and \"start using this history\" to switch to the newly imported\nhistory.\n\n\nAlternatively, if you are using your own personal Galaxy server, you can import\nthe data by:\n\n\n\n\nIn the tool panel located on the left, under Basic Tools select \nGet\n    Data \n Upload File\n. Click on the \nPaste/Fetch data\n button on the\n    bottom section of the pop-up window.\n\n\n\n\nUpload the sequence data by pasting the following links into the text\n    input area.\n    These six files are three paired-end samples from the WT flies.

You don't need to specify\n    the type for this file as Galaxy will auto-detect the file as a GTF\n    file.\n    \n\n    https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_377/public/rna_seq_basic/ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf\n    \n\n    You should now have 13 files in your history.\n\n\nNote:\n If you log out of Galaxy and log back at a later time your data\nand results from previous experiments will be available in the right panel\nof your screen called the \u2018History\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  View and have an understanding of the files involved in RNA-seq analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have the following files in your Galaxy history:\n\n\n6 files containing paired-ended reads for the WT samples:\n\n\n\nWT_01_R1.fastq\n\n\nWT_01_R2.fastq\n\n\nWT_02_R1.fastq\n\n\nWT_02_R2.fastq\n\n\nWT_03_R1.fastq\n\n\nWT_03_R2.fastq\n\n\n\n\n6 files containing paired-ended reads for the KO samples:\n\n\n\nKO_01_R1.fastq\n\n\nKO_01_R2.fastq\n\n\nKO_02_R1.fastq\n\n\nKO_02_R2.fastq\n\n\nKO_03_R1.fastq\n\n\nKO_03_R2.fastq\n\n\n\n\nAnd 1 gene annotation file:\n\n\n\nensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf\n\n\n\n\nThese files can be renamed by clicking the \npen icon\n if you wish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 12 sequencing files are in FASTQ format and have the file\n    extension: .fastq. If you are not familiar with the FASTQ format, \nclick\n    here for an overview\n.  \n\n\nEach condition has three samples, and each sample has two files (an R1\nfile containing forward reads and an R2 file containing reverse reads).\n\n\nClick on the \neye icon\n to the top right of any FASTQ file to view the\nfirst part of the file.\n\n\nNote:\n Since the reads in this dataset are synthetic, they do not have\nreal quality scores.\n\n\nNote:\n The reads are paired-end, i.e. WT_01_R1.fastq and\nWT_01_R2.fastq are paired reads from one sequencing run. If you're\nunfamiliar with paired-end sequencing, you can read about it\n\nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gene annotation file (ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf) is in GTF format. This file\n    describes where the genes are located in the D. melanogaster reference\n    genome, filtered for genes on chromosome 4.\n    Each feature is defined by a chromosomal start and end point, feature type\n    (CDS, gene, exon etc), and parent gene and transcript.\n    We will examine this file more closely later in Section 3 of this\n    tutorial.\n    More information on the GTF format can be found\n    \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Alignment with HISAT2\n\n\nIn this section we map the reads in our FASTQ files to a reference genome. As\nthese reads originate from mRNA, we expect some of them will cross exon/intron\nboundaries when we align them to the reference genome. We will use HISAT to\nperform our alignment. HISAT2 is a fast, splice-aware, alignment program that\nis a successor to TopHat2. More information on\nHISAT2 can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n1.  Align the RNA-seq reads to a reference genome.\n\n\nIn the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select\n\nNGS: RNA Analysis \n HISAT2\n and set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nInput data format\n FASTQ\n\n\nSingle end or paired reads?\n Individual paired reads\n\n\n\n\nForward reads:\n\n(Click on the \nmultiple datasets icon\n and select all six of the forward\nFASTQ files ending in *1.fastq. This should be correspond to every\nsecond file (1,3,5,7,9,11). This can be done by holding down the\nctrl key (Windows) or the command key (OSX) to select multiple files.)\n\n\n\n\nWT_01_R1.fastq\n\n\nWT_02_R1.fastq\n\n\nWT_03_R1.fastq\n\n\nKO_01_R1.fastq\n\n\nKO_02_R1.fastq\n\n\nKO_03_R1.fastq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse reads:\n\n(Click on the \nmultiple datasets icon\n and select all six of the reverse\nFASTQ files ending in *2.fastq.)  \n\n\n\n\nWT_01_R2.fastq\n\n\nWT_02_R2.fastq\n\n\nWT_03_R2.fastq\n\n\nKO_01_R2.fastq\n\n\nKO_02_R2.fastq\n\n\nKO_03_R2.fastq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource for the reference genome to align against:\n Use\nbuilt-in genome\n\n\nSelect a reference genome:\n D. melanogaster Apr. 2006 (BDGP R5/dm3)\n  (dm3)\n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This may take a few minutes, depending on how busy the server is.\n\n\n2.  Examine the alignment stats\n\n\nHISAT2 outputs one bam file for each set of paired-end read files. Rename the 6\nfiles into a more meaningful name (e.g. 'HISAT on data 2 and data 1' to 'WT_01.bam')\nby using the \npen icon\n next to the file.\n\n\nThese files are BAM files (short for\n\nBinary Alignment Map\n)\nand like the name suggests, is a binary file. This means we can't use the\neye icon to view the data in Galaxy; we need to use software that can read the\nfile or convert it into it's plain-text equivalent (SAM) to view it as text.\nIn section 3, we'll use a genome viewer to view our alignments.\n\n\nHISAT2 also outputs some information to stderr which we can preview by\nclicking on the dataset name. To view the raw file, click the \"info\" button\n(view details) of a dataset, say WT_01.bam, and find the \"Tool Standard Error\"\nrow under \"Job Information\" in the table. Click the \"stderr\" link to view\nthe alignment summary output.\n\n\n16046 reads; of these:\n  16046 (100.00%) were paired; of these:\n    104 (0.65%) aligned concordantly 0 times\n    13558 (84.49%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time\n    2384 (14.86%) aligned concordantly \n1 times\n    ----\n    104 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:\n      1 (0.96%) aligned discordantly 1 time\n    ----\n    103 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:\n      206 mates make up the pairs; of these:\n        106 (51.46%) aligned 0 times\n        91 (44.17%) aligned exactly 1 time\n        9 (4.37%) aligned \n1 times\n99.67% overall alignment rate\n\n\n\n\nHere we see we have a very high alignment rate, which is expected since the\ndata we have is simulated and has no contamination.\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Visualise the aligned reads\n\n\nThe purpose of this step is to :\n\n\n\n\nvisualise the quantitative, exon-based nature of RNA-seq data\n\n\nvisualise the expression differences between samples represented by the\n  quantity of reads, and\n\n\nbecome familiar with the \nIntegrative Genomics Viewer\n  (IGV)\n-- an interactive\n  visualisation tool by the Broad Institute.  \n\n\n\n\nTo visualise the alignment data:\n\n\n\n\nClick on one of the BAM files, for example 'WT_01.bam'.\n\n\nClick on Display with IGV \n'webcurrent'\n (or 'local' if you have IGV\n    installed on your computer. You will need to open IGV before you click on\n    'local'). This should download a .jnlp Java Web Start file to your\n    computer. Open this file to run IGV. (You will need Java installed on your\n    computer to run IGV)\n\n\nOnce IGV opens, it will show you the BAM file. (Note:\n    this may take a bit of time as the data is downloaded to IGV)\n\n\nSelect \nchr4\n from the second drop box under the toolbar. Zoom in to\n    view alignments of reads to the reference genome.\n    You should see the characteristic distribution of RNA-seq reads across\n    the exons of the genes, with some gaps at intron/exon boundaries.\n    The number of reads aligned to a particular gene is proportional to the\n    abundance of the RNA derived from that gene in the sequenced sample.\n    (Note that IGV already has a list of known genes of most major organisms\n    including Drosophila, which is why you can see the genes in the bottom\n    panel of IGV.)\n\n\n\n\nView differentially expressed genes by viewing two alignment files\n    simultaneously. The aim of this tutorial is to statistically test\n    differential expression, but first it\u2019s useful to reassure ourselves\n    that the data looks right at this stage by comparing the aligned reads\n    for condition 1 (WT) and condition 2 (KO).\n\n\nSelect 'KO_02.bam' and click on 'display with IGV local'. This time we are\nusing the \n'local'\n link, as we already have an IGV window up and running\nlocally from the last step. Once the file has loaded, try to find some\ngenes that look differentially expressed.\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't find any, try changing the location to\n\nchr4:816349-830862\n using the field on the top toolbar.\nThe 'Sox102F' gene in this area looks like it has many more reads\nmapped in WT than in KO. Hover over the coverage track to view the read\ndepth of the area. But, of course, it may be that there are many more\nreads in the library for WT than KO. So we need to statistically\nnormalise the read counts before we can say anything definitive,\nwhich we will do in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional]\n Visualise the aligned reads in Trackster\n\nIf you have trouble getting IGV to work, you can also use the inbuilt\nGalaxy genome browser, Trackster, to visualise alignments. Trackster has fewer\nfeatures than IGV, but sometimes it may be more convenient to use as it only\nrequires the browser.\n\n\n\n\nOn the top bar of Galaxy, select \nVisualization \n New Track Browser\n.\n\n\nName your new visualization and select D. melanogaster (dm3) as the\n    reference genome build.\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Datasets to Visualization\n button and select WT_01.bam and\n    KO_01.bam by using the checkboxes on the left.\n\n\nSelect chr4 from the dropdown box. You can zoom in and out using the\n    buttons on the top toolbar. You can also add more tracks using the Add\n    Tracks icon located on the top right.\n\n\nNext to the drop down list, click on the chromosomal position number\n    display and specify the location \nchr4:816349-830862\n.  \n\n\n\n\nBefore starting the next section, leave the Trackster interface and return\nto the analysis view of Galaxy by clicking 'Analyze Data' on the top\nGalaxy toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nSection 4. Quantification\n\n\nHTSeq-count counts the number of the reads from each bam file that map to the\ngenomic features in the provided annotation file. For each feature (a\ngene for example) we will obtain a numerical value associated with the\nexpression of that feature in our sample (i.e. the number of reads that\nwere aligned to that gene).\n\n\n1.  Examine the GTF file\n\n\nClick on the \neye icon\n to display the ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf file in Galaxy.\n\n\nThis GTF file is essentially a list of chromosomal features\nwhich together define genes. Each feature is in turn defined by a\nchromosomal start and end point, feature type (CDS, gene, exon etc),\nand parent gene and transcript. Importantly, a gene may have many features,\nbut one feature will belong to only one gene.\nMore information on the GTF format can be found\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nThe ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf file contains ~4900 features which together define\nthe 92 known genes on chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster.\n\n\n2.  Run HTSeq-count\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse HTSeq-count to count the number of reads for each feature.\n\n    In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select\n    \nNGS: RNA Analysis \n htseq-count\n and set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nAligned SAM/BAM File:\n\n  (Select 'Multiple datasets', then select all six bam files using the shift key.)\n\n\nWT_01.bam\n\n\nWT_02.bam\n\n\nWT_03.bam\n\n\nKO_01.bam\n\n\nKO_02.bam\n\n\nKO_03.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGFF File:\n ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf\n\n\nStranded:\n No\n\n\nID Attribute:\n gene_name\n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous step, each input BAM file outputted two files. The first\n    file contains the counts for each of our genes. The second file\n    (ending with \"(no feature)\") contains the stats for the reads that weren't\n    able to be uniquely aligned to a gene. We don't need the \"(no feature)\"\n    files so we can remove then with the delete \"X\" button on the top right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the remaining six files from htseq-count to meaningful names,\n    such as WT_01, WT_02, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  Generate a count matrix\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a combined count matrix by combining our six files.\n    In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select\n    \nNGS: RNA Analysis \n Generate count matrix\n and set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\nCount files from your history:\n\n    (Select all six count files using the shift key.)\n\n\nWT_01\n\n\nWT_02\n\n\nWT_03\n\n\nKO_01\n\n\nKO_02\n\n\nKO_03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the outputted matrix by using the \neye icon\n.\n\nEach column corresponds to a sample and each row corresponds to a gene. By\nsight, see if you can find a gene you think is differentially expressed\njust by looking at the counts.\n\n\nWe now have a count matrix which we will now use to find differentially\nexpressed genes between WT samples and KO samples.\n\n\n\n\nSection 5. Degust\n\n\nDegust is an interactive visualiser for analysing RNA-seq data. It runs as a\nweb service and can be found at \ndegust.erc.monash.edu/\n.\n\n\n\n\n1. Load count data into Degust\n\n\n\n\nIn Galaxy, download the count matrix you generated in the last section\n    using the \ndisk icon\n.\n\n\nGo to \ndegust.erc.monash.edu/\n\n    and click on \"Upload your counts file\".\n\n\nClick \"Choose file\" and upload the recently downloaded Galaxy tabular file\n    containing your RNA-seq counts.\n\n\n\n\n2. Configure your uploaded data\n\n\n\n\nGive your visualisation a name.\n\n\nFor the Info column, select \"gene_id\".\n\n\nAdd two conditions: WT and KO. For each condition, select the three\n    samples which correspond with the condition.\n\n\nSet min gene CPM to 1 in at least 3 samples.\n\n\nClick \nSave changes\n and view your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead through the Degust tour of features. Explore the parallel coordinates plot,\nMA plot, MDS plot, heatmap and gene list. Each is fully interactive and\ninfluences other portions on the display depending on what is selected.\n\n\n\n\nOn the right side of the page is an options module which can set thresholds to\nfilter genes using statistical significance or absolute-fold-change.\n\n\nOn the left side is a dropdown box you can specify the method (Voom/Limma or\nedgeR) used to perform differential expression analysis on the data. You can\nalso view the R code by clicking \"Show R code\" under the options module on\nthe right.\n\n\n4. Explore the demo data\n\n\nDegust also provides an example dataset with 4 conditions and more genes. You\ncan play with the demo dataset by clicking on the \"Try the demo\" button on the\nDegust homepage. The demo dataset includes a column with an EC number for each\ngene. This means genes can be displayed on Kegg pathways using the module on\nthe right.\n\n\n\n\nSection 5. DESeq2\n\n\nIn this section we'll use the \"DESeq2\" tool in Galaxy to do our differential\ngene analysis. This tool uses the separate HTSeq files we generated in section\n4.\n\n\nSimilar to Voom/Limma or edgeR that was used in Degust to statistically test\nour data, DESeq2 will:\n\n\n\n\nstatistically test for expression differences in normalised read counts for\n    each gene, taking into account the variance observed between samples,  \n\n\nfor each gene, calculate the p-value of the gene being differentially\n    expressed-- this is the probability of seeing the data or something more\n    extreme given the null hypothesis (that the gene is not differentially\n    expressed between the two conditions),\n\n\nfor each gene, estimate the fold change in expression between the two\n    conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse DESeq2 to find differentially expressed features from the count data.\n\n    In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select \nNGS: RNA Analysis\n    \n DESeq2\n and set the parameters as follows:\n\n\n1: Factor\n\n\nSpecify a factor name:\n condition\n\n\n1: Factor level:\n\n\nSpecify a factor level:\n WT\n\n(Select the three WT htseq-count files.)\n\n\nWT_01\n\n\nWT_02\n\n\nWT_03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2: Factor level:\n\n\nSpecify a factor level:\n KO\n\n(Select the three KO htseq-count files.)\n\n\nKO_01\n\n\nKO_02\n\n\nKO_03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at the outputs of DESeq2. We will now filter significant\n    (adjusted p-value \n 0.05) genes from the DESeq2 result file.\n\n    Under Basic Tools, click on \nFilter and Sort \n Filter\n:\n\n\nFilter:\n \"DESeq2 result file on data ...\"\n\n\nWith following condition:\n c7 \n 0.05\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many differentially expressed genes with adjusted p-value \n 0.05 are there?\n\n\n\n\nSection 6. The importance of replicates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the previous differential expression analysis with two samples in\n    each group instead of three. How do you expect your results to differ when\n    using fewer samples?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter genes with adjusted-p-value \n 0.05. How many genes are significant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun DESeq2 again, using only one sample from each group. How many genes are\n    now significant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you find genes that were identified as differentially expressed when\n    using three samples in each condition that were not identified as\n    differentially expressed when using two samples? What do you expect these\n    gene's counts or logFC values to look like compared to genes that remained\n    statistically significance? Have a look at the counts or the logFC values\n    of these genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe identification of differentially expressed genes is based on the size\nof the difference in expression and the variance observed across multiple\nreplicates. This demonstrates how important it is to have biological replicates\nin differential gene expression experiments.\n\n\nMyoglianin is an example of a gene that showed up as differentially expressed\nwhen we did a 3 vs 3 comparsion but not with a 2 vs 2 comparsion.\nIf we say that genes like Myoglianin was \ntruly\n differentially expressed, we\ncan call these instances where the true differentially expressed genes are not\nidentified as false negatives. Generally, increasing replicates decreases the\nnumber of false negatives.\n\n\nIt is also more likely to see more false positives when using an insufficient\nnumber of replicates. False positives can be defined as identifiying a gene as\ndifferentially expressed when it is, in reality, not.\n\n\n\n\nOptional extension\n\n\nHave a go at doing another differential expression analysis with the following\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae data from chromosome I.

To visualise the alignment data:   Click on one of the BAM files, for example 'WT_01.bam'.  Click on Display with IGV  'webcurrent'  (or 'local' if you have IGV\n    installed on your computer. You will need to open IGV before you click on\n    'local'). This should download a .jnlp Java Web Start file to your\n    computer. Open this file to run IGV. (You will need Java installed on your\n    computer to run IGV)  Once IGV opens, it will show you the BAM file. (Note:\n    this may take a bit of time as the data is downloaded to IGV)  Select  chr4  from the second drop box under the toolbar. Zoom in to\n    view alignments of reads to the reference genome.\n    You should see the characteristic distribution of RNA-seq reads across\n    the exons of the genes, with some gaps at intron/exon boundaries.\n    The number of reads aligned to a particular gene is proportional to the\n    abundance of the RNA derived from that gene in the sequenced sample.\n    (Note that IGV already has a list of known genes of most major organisms\n    including Drosophila, which is why you can see the genes in the bottom\n    panel of IGV.)   View differentially expressed genes by viewing two alignment files\n    simultaneously. The aim of this tutorial is to statistically test\n    differential expression, but first it\u2019s useful to reassure ourselves\n    that the data looks right at this stage by comparing the aligned reads\n    for condition 1 (WT) and condition 2 (KO).  Select 'KO_02.bam' and click on 'display with IGV local'. This time we are\nusing the  'local'  link, as we already have an IGV window up and running\nlocally from the last step. Once the file has loaded, try to find some\ngenes that look differentially expressed.   If you can't find any, try changing the location to chr4:816349-830862  using the field on the top toolbar.\nThe 'Sox102F' gene in this area looks like it has many more reads\nmapped in WT than in KO. Hover over the coverage track to view the read\ndepth of the area. But, of course, it may be that there are many more\nreads in the library for WT than KO. So we need to statistically\nnormalise the read counts before we can say anything definitive,\nwhich we will do in the next section.    [Optional]  Visualise the aligned reads in Trackster \nIf you have trouble getting IGV to work, you can also use the inbuilt\nGalaxy genome browser, Trackster, to visualise alignments. Trackster has fewer\nfeatures than IGV, but sometimes it may be more convenient to use as it only\nrequires the browser.   On the top bar of Galaxy, select  Visualization   New Track Browser .  Name your new visualization and select D. melanogaster (dm3) as the\n    reference genome build.  Click the  Add Datasets to Visualization  button and select WT_01.bam and\n    KO_01.bam by using the checkboxes on the left.  Select chr4 from the dropdown box. You can zoom in and out using the\n    buttons on the top toolbar. You can also add more tracks using the Add\n    Tracks icon located on the top right.  Next to the drop down list, click on the chromosomal position number\n    display and specify the location  chr4:816349-830862 .

Myoglianin is an example of a gene that showed up as differentially expressed\nwhen we did a 3 vs 3 comparsion but not with a 2 vs 2 comparsion.\nIf we say that genes like Myoglianin was  truly  differentially expressed, we\ncan call these instances where the true differentially expressed genes are not\nidentified as false negatives.

In practice, real datasets would be much larger and\nwould contain sequencing and alignment errors that make analysis more difficult.\n\n\nOur input data for this tutorial will be raw RNA-seq reads from two\nexperimental conditions and we will output a list of differentially\nexpressed genes identified to be statistically significant.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we will:  \n\n\n\n\nintroduce the types of files typically used in RNA-seq analysis\n\n\nalign RNA-seq reads with Tophat\n\n\nvisualise RNA-seq alignment data with IGV\n\n\nfind differentially expressed genes with Cuffdiff\n\n\nunderstand the importance of replicates for differential expression analysis\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial does not cover the following steps that you would do in a real\nRNA-seq DGE analysis:  \n\n\n\n\nQC (quality control) of the raw sequence data\n\n\nTrimming the reads for quality and for adaptor sequences\n\n\nQC of the RNA-seq alignment data  \n\n\n\n\nThese steps have been omitted because the data we use in this tutorial is\nsynthetic and has no quality issues, unlike real data.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial you should:\n\n\n\n\nBe familiar with the Tuxedo Protocol workflow for RNA-seq differential\n   expression analysis\n\n\nBe able to process raw RNA sequence data into a list of differentially\n   expressed genes\n\n\nBe aware of how the relationship between the number of biological replicates\n   in an experiment and the statistical power available to detect differentially\n   expressed genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nWhere does the data in this tutorial come from?\n\n\nThe data for this tutorial is from an RNA-seq experiment looking for\ndifferentially expressed genes in D. melanogaster (fruit fly) between two\nexperimental conditions. The experiment and analysis protocol we will follow\nis derived from a paper in Nature Protocols by the research group responsible\nfor one of the most widely used set of RNA-seq analysis tools: \n\"Differential\ngene and transcript expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with TopHat and\nCufflinks\"\n (Trapnell et al 2012).\n\n\nThe sequence datasets are single-end Illumina synthetic short reads,\nfiltered to only include chromosome 4 to facilitate faster mapping (which\nwould otherwise take hours). We\u2019ll use data from three biological replicates\nfrom each of the two experimental conditions.\n\n\nThe Tuxedo Protocol\n\n\nThe workflow this tutorial is based on is the Tuxedo Protocol. Reads are first\nmapped with TopHat and a transcriptome is then assembled using Cufflinks.\nCuffdiff then quantifies the expression in each condition, and tests for\ndifferential expression.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we use a simpler protocol as the D. melanogaster\ntranscriptome is already very well characterised.\n\n\nMore information about the Tuxedo protocol can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Preparation [15 min]\n\n\n1.

If you are not familiar with the FASTQ format, \nclick\n    here for an overview\n.  \n\n\nClick on the \neye icon\n to the top right of each FASTQ file to view the\nfirst part of the file.\nThe first 3 files are from the first condition (C1) and has 3\nreplicates labelled R1, R2, and R3. The next 3 FASTQ files are from\nthe second condition (C2) and has 3 replicates labelled R1, R2, and R3.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we aim to find genes which are differentially\nexpressed between condition C1 and condition C2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gene annotation file is in GTF format. This file describes where\n    the genes are located in the Drosophila reference genome.\n    We will examine this file more closely later in Section 3 of this\n    tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Since the reads in this dataset are synthetic, they do not have\nreal quality scores.\n\n\nNOTE:\n If you log out of Galaxy and log back at a later time your data\nand results from previous experiments will be available in the right panel\nof your screen called the \u2018History\u2019\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Align reads with Tophat [30 mins]\n\n\nIn this section we map the reads in our FASTQ files to a reference genome. As\nthese reads originate from mRNA, we expect some of them will cross exon/intron\nboundaries when we align them to the reference genome. Tophat is a splice-aware\nmapper for RNA-seq reads that is based on Bowtie. It uses the mapping results\nfrom Bowtie to identify splice junctions between exons. More information on\nTophat can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n1.  Align the RNA-seq short reads to a reference genome.\n\n\nIn the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select\n\nNGS: RNA Analysis \n Tophat\n and set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nIs this single-end or paired-end data?\n Single-end  \n\n\nRNA-Seq FASTQ file:\n\n  (Click on the multiple datasets icon and select all six of the FASTQ\n  files.

Examine the output files\n\n\nYou should have 5 output files for each of the FASTQ input files:\n\n\n\n\nTophat on data 1: accepted_hits:\n This is a BAM file containing\n  sequence alignment data of the reads. This file contains the location\n  of where the reads mapped to in the reference genome. We will examine\n  this file more closely in the next step.\n\n\nTophat on data 1: splice junctions:\n This file lists all the places\n  where Tophat had to split a read into two pieces to span an exon\n  junction.\n\n\nTophat on data 1: deletions\n and \nTophat on data 1: insertions:\n\n  These files list small insertions or deletions found in the reads.\n  Since we are working with synthetic reads we can ignore Tophat for\n  Illumina data 1:insertions Tophat for Illumina data 1:deletions for now.\n\n\nTophat on data 1: align_summary:\n This file gives some mapping\n  statistics including the number of reads mapped and the mapping rate.\n\n\n\n\nYou should have a total of 30 Tophat output files in your history.\n\n\n3.  Visualise the aligned reads with IGV\n\n\nThe purpose of this step is to :\n\n\n\n\nvisualise the quantitative, exon-based nature of RNA-seq data\n\n\nvisualise the expression differences between samples represented by the\n  quantity of reads, and\n\n\nbecome familiar with the \nIntegrative Genomics Viewer\n  (IGV)\n-- an interactive\n  visualisation tool by the Broad Institute.  \n\n\n\n\nTo visualise the alignment data:\n\n\n\n\nClick on one of the Tophat accepted hits files, for example 'Tophat on\n    data 1: accepted_hits'.\n\n\nClick on Display with IGV \n'webcurrent'\n (or 'local' if you have IGV\n    installed on your computer. You will need to open IGV before you click on\n    'local'). This should download a .jnlp Java Web Start file to your\n    computer. Open this file to run IGV. (You will need Java installed on your\n    computer to run IGV)\n\n\nOnce IGV opens, it will show you the accepted_hits BAM file. (Note:\n    this may take a bit of time as the data is downloaded to IGV)\n\n\nSelect \nchr4\n from the second drop box under the toolbar. Zoom in to\n    view alignments of reads to the reference genome.\n    You should see the characteristic distribution of RNA-seq reads across\n    the exons of the genes, with some gaps at intron/exon boundaries.\n    The number of reads aligned to a particular gene is proportional to the\n    abundance of the RNA derived from that gene in the sequenced sample.\n    (Note that IGV already has a list of known genes of most major organisms\n    including Drosophila, which is why you can see the genes in the bottom\n    panel of IGV.)\n\n\nView one of the splice function files such as 'TopHat on data 1: splice\n    junctions'. You will need to save this file to your local disk\n    using the \ndisk icon\n under the details of the file. Then open\n    the saved .bed file directly in IGV using the \nFile \n Load From File\n\n    option from IGV. This is because IGV doesn\u2019t automatically stream BED\n    files from Galaxy.\n    \n\n    The junctions file is loaded at the bottom of the\n    IGV window and splicing events are represented as coloured arcs. The\n    height and thickness of the arcs are proportional to the read depth.\n\n\n\n\nView differentially expressed genes by viewing two alignment files\n    simultaneously. The aim of this tutorial is to statistically test\n    differential expression, but first it\u2019s useful to reassure ourselves\n    that the data looks right at this stage by comparing the aligned reads\n    for condition 1 (C1) and condition 2 (C2).\n\n\nSelect 'TopHat on data 4: accepted_hits' (this is the accepted hits\nalignment file from first replicate of condition C2) and click on\n'display with IGV local'. This time we are using the \n'local'\n link, as\nwe already have an IGV window up and running locally from the last\nstep. One the file has loaded, change the location to\n\nchr4:325197-341887\n using the field on the top toolbar.\n\n\nThe middle gene in this area clearly looks like it has many more reads\nmapped in condition 2 than condition 1, whereas for the surrounding\ngenes the reads look about the same. The middle gene looks like it is\ndifferentially expressed. But, of course, it may be that there are\nmany more reads in the readsets for C1 and C2, and the other genes\nare underexpressed in condition 2. So we need to statistically\nnormalise the read counts before we can say anything definitive,\nwhich we will do in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  \n[Optional]\n Visualise the aligned reads in Trackster\n\n\nWe can also use the inbuilt Galaxy genome browser, Trackster, to visualise\nalignments. Trackster has fewer features than IGV, but sometimes it may be\nmore convenient to use as it only requires the browser.\n\n\n\n\nOn the top bar of Galaxy, select \nVisualization \n New Track Browser\n.\n\n\nName your new visualization and select D. melanogaster (dm3) as the\n    reference genome build.\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Datasets to Visualization\n button and select Tophat on\n    data 1: accepted_hits and Tophat on data 4: accepted_hits by using the\n    checkboxes on the left.\n\n\nSelect chr4 from the dropdown box. You can zoom in and out using the\n    buttons on the top toolbar. You can also add more tracks using the Add\n    Tracks icon located on the top right.\n\n\nNext to the drop down list, click on the chromosomal position number\n    display and specify the location \nchr4:325197-341887\n.  \n\n\n\n\nBefore starting the next section, leave the Trackster interface and return\nto the analysis view of Galaxy by clicking 'Analyze Data' on the top\nGalaxy toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Test differential expression with Cuffdiff [45 min]\n\n\nThe aim in this section is to:\n\n\n\n\ngenerate tables of normalised read counts per gene per condition based on the\n  annotated reference transcriptome,\n\n\nstatistically test for expression differences in normalised read counts for\n  each gene, taking into account the variance observed between samples,  \n\n\nfor each gene, calculate the p-value of the gene being differentially\n  expressed-- this is the probability of seeing the data or something more\n  extreme given the null hypothesis (that the gene is not differentially\n  expressed between the two conditions),\n\n\nfor each gene, estimate the fold change in expression between the two\n  conditions.\n\n\n\n\nAll these steps are rolled up into a single tool in Galaxy: Cuffdiff. Cuffdiff\nis part of the Cufflinks software suite which takes the aligned reads from\nTophat and generates normalised read counts and a list of differentially\nexpressed genes based on a reference transcriptome - in this case, the curated\nEnsembl list of D. melanogaster genes from chromosome 4 that we supply as a\nGTF (Gene Transfer Format) file.\nA more detailed explanation of Cufflinks DGE testing can be found\n\nhere\n.\n\n\n1.  Examine the reference transcriptome\n\n\nClick on the \neye icon\n to display the ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf reference\ntranscriptome file in Galaxy.\n\n\nThe reference transcriptome is essentially a list of chromosomal features\nwhich together define genes. Each feature is in turn defined by a\nchromosomal start and end point, feature type (CDS, gene, exon etc),\nand parent gene and transcript. Importantly, a gene may have many features,\nbut one feature will belong to only one gene.\nMore information on the GTF format can be found\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nThe ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf file contains ~4900 features which together define\nthe 92 known genes on chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster. Cuffdiff\nuses the reference transcriptome to aggregate read counts per gene,\ntranscript, transcription start site and coding sequence (CDS). For this\ntutorial, we\u2019ll only consider differential gene testing, but it is also\npossible to test for differential expression of transcripts or\ntranscription start sites.\n\n\n2.  Run Cuffdiff to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts\n\n\nIn the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select\n\nNGS: RNA Analysis \n Cuffdiff\n and set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nTranscripts:\n ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf\n\n\nCondition:\n  \n\n\n1: Condition\n\n\nname:\n C1\n\n\nReplicates:\n\n\nTophat on data 1: accepted_hits\n\n\nTophat on data 2: accepted_hits\n\n\nTophat on data 3: accepted_hits\n\n(Multiple datasets can be selected by holding down the shift key or\nthe ctrl key for Windows or the command key for OSX.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2: Condition\n\n\nname:\n C2\n\n\nReplicates:\n\n\nTophat on data 4: accepted_hits\n\n\nTophat on data 5: accepted_hits\n\n\nTophat on data 6: accepted_hits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow screenshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink1\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable1\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\n3.

The file consists of one row\n    for each gene from the reference transcriptome, with columns containing the\n    normalised read counts for each of the two conditions.\n    Note:  \n\n\n\n\nCuffdiff gives each gene it\u2019s own \u2018tracking_id\u2019, which equates\n  to a gene. Multiple transcription start sites are aggregated under a\n  single tracking_id.\n\n\nA gene encompasses a chromosomal locus which covers all the features\n  that make up that gene (exons, introns, 5\u2019 UTR, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspect the gene differential expression testing file\n    View the Cuffdiff file \"Cuffdiff on data x, data x, and others: gene\n    differential expression testing\" by clicking on the \neye icon\n.

One replicate is not enough.\n\n\n\n\nThe identification of differentially expressed genes is based on the size\nof the difference in expression and the variance observed across multiple\nreplicates. This demonstrates how important it is to have biological replicates\nin differential gene expression experiments.\n\n\nIf we say that genes Ank and CG2177 are \ntruly\n differentially expressed, we\ncan call these instances where the true differentially expressed genes are not\nidentified as false negatives. Generally, increasing replicates decreases the\nnumber of false negatives.\n\n\nIt is also more likely to see more false positives when using an insufficient\nnumber of replicates. False positives can be defined as identifiying a gene as\ndifferentially expressed when it is, in reality, not.\n\n\n[Optional step]\n\nRepeat this analysis, specifying groups of two replicates each. What do you\nget? How many replicates do we need to identify Ank as differentially\nexpressed?\n\n\n\n\nSection 5. Optional Extension [20 min]\n\n\nExtension on the Tuxedo Protocol\n\n\nThe full Tuxedo protocol includes other tools such as Cufflinks, Cuffmerge,\nand CummeRbund. Cufflinks and Cuffmerge can build a new reference transcriptome by\nidentifying novel transcripts and genes in the RNA-seq dataset - i.e. using these tools will allow\nyou to identify new genes and transcripts, and then analyse them for\ndifferential expression. This is critical for organisms in which the\ntranscriptome is not well characterised. CummeRbund helps visualise the data\nproduced from the Cuffdiff using the R statistical programming language.\n\n\nRead more on the full Tuxedo protocol \nhere\n.\n\n\nIf the organism we were working on did not have a well characterized reference\ntranscriptome, we would run Cufflinks and Cuffmerge to create a transcriptome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we didn't have our Drosophila GTF file containing the location of\n    known genes. We can use Cufflinks to assemble transcripts from the\n    alignment data to create GTF files.\n    From the Galaxy tool panel, select \nNGS: RNA Analysis \n Cufflinks\n and\n    set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nSAM or BAM file of aligned RNA-Seq reads:\n\n  Click on the multiple datasets icon and select all 6 BAM files from\n  Tophat\n\n\nMax Intron Length:\n 50000  \n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we want to merge the assemblies outputted by Cufflinks by selecting\n    \nNGS: RNA Analysis \n Cuffmerge\n and setting the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nGTF file(s) produced by Cufflinks:\n Select the 6 GTF files ending\n  with 'assembled transcripts' produced by Cufflinks.

To visualise the alignment data:   Click on one of the Tophat accepted hits files, for example 'Tophat on\n    data 1: accepted_hits'.  Click on Display with IGV  'webcurrent'  (or 'local' if you have IGV\n    installed on your computer. You will need to open IGV before you click on\n    'local'). This should download a .jnlp Java Web Start file to your\n    computer. Open this file to run IGV. (You will need Java installed on your\n    computer to run IGV)  Once IGV opens, it will show you the accepted_hits BAM file. (Note:\n    this may take a bit of time as the data is downloaded to IGV)  Select  chr4  from the second drop box under the toolbar. Zoom in to\n    view alignments of reads to the reference genome.\n    You should see the characteristic distribution of RNA-seq reads across\n    the exons of the genes, with some gaps at intron/exon boundaries.\n    The number of reads aligned to a particular gene is proportional to the\n    abundance of the RNA derived from that gene in the sequenced sample.\n    (Note that IGV already has a list of known genes of most major organisms\n    including Drosophila, which is why you can see the genes in the bottom\n    panel of IGV.)  View one of the splice function files such as 'TopHat on data 1: splice\n    junctions'. You will need to save this file to your local disk\n    using the  disk icon  under the details of the file.

The\n    height and thickness of the arcs are proportional to the read depth.   View differentially expressed genes by viewing two alignment files\n    simultaneously. The aim of this tutorial is to statistically test\n    differential expression, but first it\u2019s useful to reassure ourselves\n    that the data looks right at this stage by comparing the aligned reads\n    for condition 1 (C1) and condition 2 (C2).  Select 'TopHat on data 4: accepted_hits' (this is the accepted hits\nalignment file from first replicate of condition C2) and click on\n'display with IGV local'. This time we are using the  'local'  link, as\nwe already have an IGV window up and running locally from the last\nstep. One the file has loaded, change the location to chr4:325197-341887  using the field on the top toolbar.  The middle gene in this area clearly looks like it has many more reads\nmapped in condition 2 than condition 1, whereas for the surrounding\ngenes the reads look about the same. The middle gene looks like it is\ndifferentially expressed. But, of course, it may be that there are\nmany more reads in the readsets for C1 and C2, and the other genes\nare underexpressed in condition 2.

Critically, the number of short reads generated for a particular RNA is assumed to be proportional to the amount of that RNA that was present in the collected sample.\n\n\nDifferential gene expression studies can exploit RNA-seq to quantitate the amount of mRNA in different samples and statistically test the difference in expression per-gene (generally measured as the normalised number of sequence reads per gene/transcript) between the samples.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, differential gene expression analysis is complicated by the possibility of multiple isoforms for any particular gene through alternative splicing and/or multiple transcription start sites\n\n\nThe Galaxy workflow platform\n\n\nWhat is Galaxy?\n\n\nGalaxy is an online bioinformatics workflow management system.

Galaxy makes it easier to link up the tools together and visualise the entire analysis pipeline.\n\n\nGalaxy uses the concept of 'histories'.

Changes in expression of those genes are analysed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembling a transcriptome is advised if no well characterised transcriptome exists, but as \nD. melanogaster\n is a model organism we have access to well-annotated and comprehensive genomes and transcriptomes from the multitude of previous genomic analyses on \nD. melanogaster\n, so the simpler \u2018Alternate protocol\u2019 is appropriate. It also has the advantage of being simpler.\n\n\nIf we were investigating a novel organism then we would first need to characterise the transcriptome by assembling it from the experimental data, as gene expression is only meaningful in the context of a defined transcriptome.\n\n\nThe Alternate protocol\n\n\nThe overall workflow for this protocol is depicted below[^1]. Briefly, raw reads from each of the sequenced replicates for each experimental condition are aligned against a reference genome; during this process splice sites are identified and reads mapped across introns as required. The mapped reads are then used to derive counts of reads vs genes by cross referencing against a list of known genes (the \u2018reference transcriptome\u2019); these read counts are normalised within and between sample sets by a variety of methods and then statistical tests are used to assess the significance of differences between the normalised read counts of sample sets, producing a ranked list of differentially expressed genes.\n\n\nFigure 2: General workflow for testing expression differences between two experimental conditions\n\n\n\n\nTophat\n\n\nReads from experimental conditions A and B are mapped to a reference genome with TopHat. TopHat uses the Bowtie aligner as an alignment engine; it breaks up the reads that Bowtie cannot align on its own into smaller pieces called segments.\n\n\n\n\nTopHat input: Fasta or Fastq files\n\n\nTopHat output: BAM file (Compressed SAM file)\n\n\n\n\nCuffdiff\n\n\nThe reads and the reference transcriptome are fed to Cuffdiff which calculates expression levels and tests the statistical significance of the observed changes.\n\n\n\n\nCuffdiff input: Reference transcriptome as GTF file\n\n\nCuffdiff output:\n\n\nGene and transcript expression levels as tables of normalised read counts\n\n\nDifferential analysis testing on:\n\n\nGenes\n\n\nTranscripts\n\n\nTranscription Start Site (TSS) groups\n\n\nSplicing: files reporting on splicing\n\n\nPromoter: differentially spliced genes via promoter switching\n\n\nCDS: CoDing Sequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full Tuxedo Protocol\n\n\nFigure 3: Full Tuxedo protocol workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTophat: Reads from different experimental conditions are mapped to a reference genome with TopHat.

To perform differential expression we need to combine to assemblies into a single assembly.

Critically, the number of short reads generated for a particular RNA is assumed to be proportional to the amount of that RNA that was present in the collected sample.  Differential gene expression studies can exploit RNA-seq to quantitate the amount of mRNA in different samples and statistically test the difference in expression per-gene (generally measured as the normalised number of sequence reads per gene/transcript) between the samples.  In eukaryotes, differential gene expression analysis is complicated by the possibility of multiple isoforms for any particular gene through alternative splicing and/or multiple transcription start sites",

As\nthese reads originate from mRNA, we expect some of them will cross exon/intron\nboundaries when we align them to the reference genome. Tophat is a splice-aware\nmapper for RNA-seq reads that is based on Bowtie. It uses the mapping results\nfrom Bowtie to identify splice junctions between exons. More information on\nTophat can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n1.  Map/align the reads with Tophat to the S. cerevisiae reference\n\n\nIn the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select\n\nNGS: RNA Analysis \n Tophat\n and set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nIs this single-end or paired-end data?\n Paired-end (as individual datasets)  \n\n\n\n\nRNA-Seq FASTQ file, forward reads:\n\n(Click on the \nmultiple datasets icon\n and select all six of the forward\nFASTQ files ending in *1.fastq.

Visualise the aligned reads with Trackster\n\n\n\n\nOn the top bar of Galaxy, select \nVisualization \n New Track Browser\n.\n\n\nName your new visualization and select S. cerevisiae (sacCer2) as the\n    reference genome build.\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Datasets to Visualization\n button and select\n    'batch1-accepted_hits.bam' and 'chem1-accepted_hits.bam' by using the\n    checkboxes on the left.\n\n\nSelect chrI from the dropdown box. You can zoom in and out using the\n    buttons on the top toolbar.\n\n\nYou can also add more tracks using the \nAdd Tracks icon\n located on the\n    top right. Load one of the splice junction files such as 'Tophat on data 2\n    and data 1: splice junctions'.\n\n\nExplore the data and try to find a splice junction. Next to the\n    drop down list, click on the chromosomal position number\n    display and specify the location \nchrI:86985-87795\n to view an\n    intron junction.  \n\n\n\n\nIdeally we would add a gene model to the visualisation; but the\ngenes.gtf file for S. cerevisae (as downloaded from UCSC Table Browser)\nhas a slightly different naming convention for one of the chromosomes\nthan the reference genome used by Galaxy, which will cause an error to\nbe thrown by Trackster if you try to add it. This is very typical of\ngenomics currently! If you are interested, you can fiddle with the\ngenes.gtf file to rename the chromosome '2-micron' to '2micron', which\nwill fix the problem.\n\n\nBefore starting the next section, leave the Trackster interface and return\nto the analysis view of Galaxy by clicking 'Analyze Data' on the top\nGalaxy toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nSection 3.

Count reads in features [30 min]\n\n\nHTSeq-count creates a count matrix using the number of the reads from each bam\nfile that map to the genomic features in the genes.gtf. For each feature (a\ngene for example) a count matrix shows how many reads were mapped to this\nfeature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse HTSeq-count to count the number of reads for each feature.\n\n    In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select\n    \nNGS: RNA Analysis \n SAM/BAM to count matrix\n and set the parameters as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nGene model (GFF) file to count reads over from your current history:\n genes.gtf\n\n\nbam/sam file from your history:\n\n  (Select all six bam files using the shift key.)\n\n\nbatch1-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nbatch2-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nbatch3-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nchem1-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nchem2-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nchem3-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the outputted matrix by using the \neye icon\n.\n\n    Each column corresponds to a sample and each row corresponds to a gene.

We\nwill use this matrix in later sections to calculate the differentially\nexpressed genes.\n\n\n\n\nSection 5: edgeR  [30 min]\n\n\nedgeR\n\nis an R package, that is used for analysing differential expression of\nRNA-Seq data and can either use exact statistical methods or generalised\nlinear models.\n\n\n1.  Generate a list of differentially expressed genes using edgeR\n\n\nIn the Galaxy tool panel, under NGS Analysis, select\n\nNGS: RNA \n Differential_Count\n and set the parameters as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSelect an input matrix - rows are contigs, columns are counts for each\n  sample:\n bams to DGE count matrix_htseqsams2mx.xls\n\n\nTitle for job outputs:\n Differential_Counts_edgeR\n\n\nTreatment Name:\n Batch\n\n\nSelect columns containing treatment:\n  \n\n\nbatch1-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nbatch2-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nbatch3-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Name:\n Chem\n\n\nSelect columns containing control:\n  \n\n\nchem1-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nchem2-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\nchem3-accepted_hits.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun this model using edgeR:\n Run edgeR\n\n\nUse defaults for the other fields\n\n\nExecute\n\n\n\n\n2.

Samples which are more\nsimilar to each other are expected to cluster together. A count matrix often\nhas thousands of dimensions (one for each feature) and our PCA plot generated in\nthe previous step transforms the data so the most variability is represented in principal\ncomponents 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2 represented by the x-axis and y-axis respectively).\n\n\n\n\nTake note of the scales on the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis representing\nthe first principal component accounts for 96% of the variance and ranges from\napproximately -6 to +6, while the y-axis ranges from approximately -1 to +1.\n\n\nFor both conditions, the 3 replicates tend to be closer to each other than they are to replicates from the other condition.\n\n\nAdditionally, within conditions, the lower glucose (chem) condition shows more\nvariability between replicates than the higher glucose (batch) condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink2\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable2\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\n3.

Also note that the genes are ranked in\norder of statistical significance. This is critical for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the online\n    tool GOrilla\n\n\n\n\nGo to \ncbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il\n\n\nChoose Organism:\n Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n\n\nChoose running mode:\n Single ranked list of genes\n\n\nOpen the gene list you downloaded in the previous step in a text editor.\n  Select the full list, then copy and paste the list into the text box.\n\n\nChoose an Ontology:\n Process\n\n\nSearch Enriched GO terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the analysis has finished running, you will be redirected to a\n    page depicting the GO enriched biological processes and its significance\n    (indicated by colour), based on the genes you listed.\n\n\n\nScroll down to view a table of GO terms and their significance scores.\nIn the last column, you can toggle the \n[+] Show genes\n to see the\nlist of associated genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment with different ontology categories (Function, Component) in GOrilla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this stage you are interpreting the experiment in different ways, potentially\ndiscovering information that will lead you to further lab experiments. This\nis driven by your biological knowledge of the problem space. There are an\nunlimited number of methods for further interpretation of which GSEA is just one.\n\n\n\n\nOptional extension: Degust\n\n\nDegust is an interactive visualiser for analysing RNA-seq data.

            "text": "RNA-Seq Experimental Design\n\n\nWhat is RNA-seq?\n\n\nRNA-seq is a method of measuring gene expression using shotgun sequencing. The\nprocess involves reverse transcribing RNA into cDNA, then sequencing fragments\non a high-throughput platform such as Illumina to obtain a large number of\nshort reads. For each sample, the reads are then aligned to a genome, and the\nnumber of reads aligned to each gene or feature is recorded.\n\n\nA typical RNA-seq experiment aims to find differentially expressed genes\nbetween two conditions (e.g. up and down-regulated genes in knock-out mice\ncompared to wild-type mice). RNA-seq can also be used to discover new\ntranscripts, splice variants, and fusion genes.\n\n\nWhy is a good experimental design vital?\n\n\nAn RNA-seq experiment produces high dimensional data. This means we get a huge\nnumber of observations for a small number of samples. For example, the\nexpression of ~20,000 genes could be measured for 6 samples (3 knock-out and 3\nwild-type). A frequently used approach to analyse RNA-seq data is to fit each\ngene to a linear model where for each of the 20,000 genes, parameters need to\nbe estimated using a small number of observations. To complicate matters, each\nmeasurement of gene expression is comprised of a mix of biological signal and\nunwanted noise. Thus, in order to perform a robust statistical analysis, the\nmethodology must be carefully designed.\n\n\nBefore you begin any RNA-seq experiment, some questions you should ask\nyourself are:\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you expect to find differentially expressed genes in the particular\n   tissue?\n\n\nWhat types of genes do you expect to find differentially expressed?\n\n\nWhat are the sources of variability from your samples?\n\n\nWhere do you expect most of your variation to come from?\n\n\n\n\nA coherent experimental design is the groundwork of a successful experiment.\nYou should invest time and thought in designing a robust experiment as failing\nto think this step through can lead to unusable data and wasted time, money,\nand effort.\n\n\nIt is also useful to think about the statistical methods you will use to\nanalyse the data. If you're planning to bring a data analyst or\nbioinformatician onboard for data analysis, you should include him or her in\nthe experimental design stage.\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nBefore progressing, it may be useful to define some terms which are commonly\nused in RNA-seq.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nVariability:\n    \nA measure of how much the data is spread around. Variance is\n    mathematically defined as the average of the squared difference between\n    observations and the expected value. Simply put, a larger variance means\n    it is harder to identify differentially expressed genes.\n  \n\n    \nFeature:\n    \nA defined genomic region. Usually a gene in RNA-seq, but can also\n    refer to any region such as an exon or an isoform. In RNA-seq, an estimate\n    of abundance is obtained for each feature.\n  \n\n    \nBiological replicates:\n    \nSamples that have been obtained from biologically separate samples.\n    This can mean different individual organisms (e.g. tissue samples from\n    different mice), different samplings of the same tumour, or different\n    population of cells grown separately from each other but originating from\n    the same cell-line. For example, the samples obtained from three different\n    knock-out mice could be considered biological replicates in a knock-out\n    versus wild-type experiment. A biological replicate combines both technical\n    and biological variability as it is also an independent case of all the\n    technical steps.\n  \n\n    \nTechnical replicates:\n    \nSamples in which the starting biological sample is the same, but the\n    replicates are processed separately. For example, if a biological sample\n    is divided and two different library preps are processed and sequenced,\n    those two samples would be considered technical replicates.\n  \n\n    \nCovariate:\n    \nThe term 'covariate' is often used interchangeably with 'factor' or\n    'variable' in RNA-seq. The term refers to a property of the sample which\n    may have some influence on gene expression and should be represented in\n    the RNA-seq model. Covariates in RNA-seq are often categorical (e.g.\n    treatment condition, sex, batch), but continuous factors are also possible\n    (e.g. time points, age). A linear model will contain terms to represent\n    the relationships between covariates and each sample. Each possible value\n    a factor can take is called a level (e.g. 'male' and 'female' are two\n    levels in the factor 'sex'). Factors can either be directly of interest\n    to the experiment (e.g. treatment condition) or not of interest (also\n    known as nuisance variables) (e.g. sex, batch). The purpose of covariates\n    is to explain the variance seen in samples.\n  \n\n    \nConfounding variable:\n    \nA confounding variable is a nuisance variable that is associated with\n    the factor of interest. Possible confounding factors should be controlled\n    for so they don't interfere with analysis. For example, if all knock-out\n    mice samples were harvested in the morning and all wild-type mice samples\n    were harvested in the afternoon, the time of sample collection would be a\n    confounding factor as the effects from sample collection time and from the\n    knock-out cannot be separated.\n  \n\n    \nStatistical power:\n    \nThe ability to identify differentially expressed genes when there\n    really is a difference. This is partly dependent on variance and therefore\n    is affected by the number of replicates available and sequencing depth.\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of replicates to estimate variance\n\n\nWhen performing a differential gene expression analysis, we look at the\nexpression values of each gene and try to determine if the expression is\nsignificantly different in the different conditions (e.g. knock-out and\nwild-type). The ability to distinguish whether a gene is differentially\nexpressed is partly determined by the estimates of variability obtained by\nusing multiple observations in each condition.\n\n\nVariability is present in two forms: technical variability and biological\nvariability.\n\n\nCombined biological and technical variability is measured using biological \nreplicates. Biological variability is the main source of variability and is \ndue to natural variation in the population and within cells. This includes \ndifferent individuals having different levels of a particular gene and the \nstochastic nature of expression levels in different cells.\n\n\nTechnical variability is measured using technical replicates. Technical\nvariability is often very small compared to biological variability.  Usually\nthe question is whether an observed difference is greater than the total \nvariability (i.e. significant).  As combined variability is measured by \nbiological replicates technical replicates are only important if you need to\nknow the degree of biological variability or technical variability.  An\nexample of wanting technical variability would be method development. The\nmain source of technical variation comes from RNA processing and from \nlibrary prep. Variability from sequencing in different flow cells or different\nlanes is usually minimal. Generally, creating technical replicates from multiple\nlibrary preps is unnecessary for RNA-seq experiments.\n\n\nThe amount of variance between your biological replicates will affect the\noutcome of your analysis. Ideally, you aim to have minimal variability between\nsamples so you only measure the effect of the condition of interest. Too much\nvariability between samples can drown out the signal of truly differentially\nexpressed genes. Controlling for possible confounding factors between\nconditions is also important to prevent falsely attributing differential\nexpression to the condition of interest.\n\n\nStrategies to minimise variation between samples and to control confounding\nvariables include:\n\n\n\n\nchoosing organisms from the same litter,\n\n\nchoosing organisms of the same sex if possible,\n\n\nusing a constant sample collection time,\n\n\nhaving the same laboratory technician perform each library prep,\n\n\nrandomising samples to prevent a confounding batch effect if all samples\n   can't be processed at one time.\n\n\n\n\nIf variation between samples can not be removed it should be balanced between\nconditions of interest as much as possible, and carefully recorded to allow\nits effect to be measured and potentially removed during analysis.\n\n\nHow many replicates and how many reads do I need?\n\n\nTwo very common question asked are:\n\n\n\n\nhow many biological replicates do I need, and\n\n\nwhat sequencing depth is needed for each sample\n\n\n\n\nin order to have enough statistical power for my RNA-seq experiment?\n\n\nThese questions cannot be precisely answered without a pilot study. A small\namount of data (minimum of two biological replicates for each condition with\nat least 10M reads) can estimate the amount of biological variation, which\ndetermines how many biological replicates are required. Performing a pilot\nstudy is highly recommended to estimate statistical power and identify\npossible problems before investing more time and money into the project.\n\n\nScotty\n is a web-based tool\nthat uses data generated from a pilot study to optimize a design for\nstatistical power. With a limited budget, one must balance sequence coverage\nand number of biological replicates. Scotty also has a cost estimate feature\nwhich returns the most powerful design within budget constraints.\n\n\nAs a general rule, the number of biological replicates should never be below 3.\nFor a basic RNA-seq differential expression experiment, 10M to 20M reads per\nsample is usually enough.  If similar data exists it can be helpful to check\nthe read counts for key genes of interest to estimate the required depth.\n\n\nBiological variability is usually the largest effect limiting the power of \nRNA-seq analysis.  The most improvement in an experiment will usually be \nachieved by increasing the biological replication to improve estimation of \nthe biological variation.\n\n\nIt is often possible to design experiments where the analysis is done \nincrementally such that a pilot study is added to with an additional block of\nsamples or a pool of libraries is sequenced to additional depth. In these cases\ncare must be taken to balance the design in a manner that each stage is a\nvalid experiment in its own right.  This can allow a focused question to be \nanswered in the first stage, with an ability to either address issues or \nprogress to a second stage with additional questions.\n\n\nSequencing options to consider\n\n\nHow much total RNA is needed:\n\nMany sequencing centres such as\n\nAGRF\n\nrecommend at least 250ng of total RNA for RNA sequencing. It is possible to go\nas low as 100ng of total RNA, but results are not guaranteed. The quality of\nRNA is also important when making libraries. A RNA Integrity Number (RIN) is a\nnumber from 1 (poor) to 10 (good) and can indicate how much degradation there\nis in the sample. A poor score can lead to over representation at the 3' end\nof the transcript and low yield. Samples with low RIN scores (below 8) are\nnot recommended for sequencing.  Care should also be taken to ensure RIN is\nconsistent between conditions to avoid confounding this technical effect with\nthe biological question.\n\n\nChoosing an enrichment method:\n\nRibosomal RNA makes up \n95% of total cellular RNA, so a preparation for\nRNA-seq must either enrich for mRNA using poly-A enrichment, or deplete rRNA.\nPoly-A enrichment is recommended for most standard RNA-seq experiments, but\nwill not provide information about microRNAs and other non-coding RNA species.\nIn general, ribo-depleted RNA-seq data will contain more noise, however, the\nprotocol is recommended if you have poor or variable quality of RNA as the 3\u2019\nbias of poly-A enrichment will be more pronounced with increased RNA\ndegradation. The amount of RNA needed for each method differs. For Poly-A\nenrichment a minimum of 100ng is needed while for ribo-depletion, a minimum of\n200ng is recommended.\n\n\nChoosing read type:\n\nFor basic differential expression analysis RNA-seq experiments, single-end\nsequencing is recommended to obtain gene transcript counts. In more advanced\nexperiments, paired-ends are useful for determining transcript structure and\ndiscovering splice variants.\n\n\nChoosing strandedness:\n  \n\n\nWith a non-directional (unstranded) protocol, there is no way to identify\nwhether a read originated from the coding strand or its reverse complement.\nNon-directional protocols allow mapping of a read to a genomic location, but\nnot the direction in which the RNA was transcribed. They are therefore used to\ncount transcripts for known genes, and are recommended for basic RNA-seq\nexperiments. Directional protocols (stranded) preserve strand information and\nare useful for novel transcript discovery.\n\n\nMultiplexing:\n\nMultiplexing is an approach to sequence multiple samples in the same\nsequencing lane. By sequencing all samples in the same lane, multiplexing can\nalso minimise bias from lane effects.\n\n\nSpike-in controls:\n\nRNA-seq spike-in controls are a set of synthetic RNAs of known concentration\nwhich act as negative or positive controls. These controls have been used for\nnormalisation and quality control, but recent work has shown that the amount\nof technical variability in their use dramatically reduces their utility.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nA good experimental design is vital for a successful experiment. If you're\n   planning to work with a data analyst or bioinformatician, include them in\n   the design stage.\n\n\nAim to minimise variability by identifying possible sources of variance in\n   your samples.\n\n\nBiological replicates are important. The number of biological replicates\n   you should have should never be below 3. Technical replicates are often\n   unnecessary.\n\n\nPilot studies are highly recommended for identifying how many replicates\n   and how many reads you should have for enough statistical power in your\n   experiment.\n\n\nFor basic RNA-seq experiments, poly-A enriched, single-ended, unstranded\n   sequencing at depths of 10M to 20M is probably what you want.",

Variance is\n    mathematically defined as the average of the squared difference between\n    observations and the expected value. Simply put, a larger variance means\n    it is harder to identify differentially expressed genes.\n   \n     Feature:\n     A defined genomic region. Usually a gene in RNA-seq, but can also\n    refer to any region such as an exon or an isoform. In RNA-seq, an estimate\n    of abundance is obtained for each feature.\n   \n     Biological replicates:\n     Samples that have been obtained from biologically separate samples.\n    This can mean different individual organisms (e.g. tissue samples from\n    different mice), different samplings of the same tumour, or different\n    population of cells grown separately from each other but originating from\n    the same cell-line. For example, the samples obtained from three different\n    knock-out mice could be considered biological replicates in a knock-out\n    versus wild-type experiment. A biological replicate combines both technical\n    and biological variability as it is also an independent case of all the\n    technical steps.\n   \n     Technical replicates:\n     Samples in which the starting biological sample is the same, but the\n    replicates are processed separately. For example, if a biological sample\n    is divided and two different library preps are processed and sequenced,\n    those two samples would be considered technical replicates.\n   \n     Covariate:\n     The term 'covariate' is often used interchangeably with 'factor' or\n    'variable' in RNA-seq. The term refers to a property of the sample which\n    may have some influence on gene expression and should be represented in\n    the RNA-seq model. Covariates in RNA-seq are often categorical (e.g.\n    treatment condition, sex, batch), but continuous factors are also possible\n    (e.g. time points, age). A linear model will contain terms to represent\n    the relationships between covariates and each sample. Each possible value\n    a factor can take is called a level (e.g. 'male' and 'female' are two\n    levels in the factor 'sex'). Factors can either be directly of interest\n    to the experiment (e.g. treatment condition) or not of interest (also\n    known as nuisance variables) (e.g. sex, batch). The purpose of covariates\n    is to explain the variance seen in samples.\n   \n     Confounding variable:\n     A confounding variable is a nuisance variable that is associated with\n    the factor of interest. Possible confounding factors should be controlled\n    for so they don't interfere with analysis.

The data was downloaded from the \nNCBI Short Read Archive (SRA)\n (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/). The specific sample is a public dataset published in April 2012 with SRA accession number ERR048396.\n\n\nWe will also use a FASTA file containing the sequences of the Illumina adapters used in the sequencing process. It is desirable to remove these as they are artificial sequences and not part of the bacterium that was sequenced.\n\n\nWe will use software called \nVelvet\n (Zerbino et al 2008) for the main de novo assembly, as well as some other peripheral software for pre- and post-processing of the data.

We firstly need to check the quality of the input data as this will help us choose the most appropriate range of input parameters for the assembly and will guide us on an appropriate quality trimming/cleanup strategy. We will then use an iterative method to assemble the reads using the \nVelvet Optimiser\n (a program that performs lots of Velvet assemblies searching for an optimum outcome.)

We will then evaluate their quality and choose an appropriate regime for quality filtering using Trimmomatic (a fastq read quality trimmer.)\n\n\nMore detailed description of FastQC quality analysis can be found here.\n\n\nMore detailed description of Trimmomatic read quality filtering can be found here.\n\n\nRun FastQC on both input read files\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tools menu in the left hand panel of Galaxy, select \nNGS QC and manipulation \n FastQC: Comprehensive QC\n (down the bottom of this category) and run with these parameters:\n\n\n\"FASTQ reads\": \nERR048396_1.fastq\n\n\nUse default for other fields\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\nNow repeat the above process on the second read file: \nERR048396_2.fastq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Note: This may take a few minutes, depending on how busy Galaxy is.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to do both read files as the quality can be very different between them.\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of FastQC interface in Galaxy\n\n\n\n\nExamine the FastQC output\n\n\nYou should have two output objects from the first step:\n\n\n\n\nFastQC_ERR048396_1.fastqc.html\n\n\nFastQC_ERR048396_2.fastqc.html\n\n\n\n\nThese are a html outputs which show the results of all of the tests FastQC performed on the read files.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \n icon of each of these objects in turn to see the FastQC output.\n\n\n\n\nThe main parts of the output to evaluate are:\n\n\n\n\nBasic statistics.

This is a very good quality dataset. 20 is often used as a cutoff for reliable quality.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of FastQC output in Galaxy\n\n\n\n\nQuality trim the reads using Trimmomatic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tools menu in the left hand panel of Galaxy, select \nNGS QC and manipulation \n Trimmomatic\n and run with these parameters (only the non-default selections are listed here):\n\n\n\n\n\"Input FASTQ file (R1/first of pair)\": \nERR048396_1.fastq\n\n\n\"Input FASTQ file (R2/second of pair)\": \nERR048396_2.fastq\n\n\n\"Perform initial ILLUMINACLIP step?\": \nYes\n\n\n\"Adapter sequences to use\": \nTruSeq3 (additional seqs) (paired end, for MiSeq and HiSeq)\n\n\n\"How accurate ... read alignment\": \n40\n\n\n\"How accurate ... against a read\": \n15\n\n\nWe will use the default settings for the SLIDING_WINDOW operation but we need to add a few more Trimmomatic operations.\n\n\nClick \nInsert Trimmomatic Operation\n\n\nAdd \nCut bases ...

You\u2019ll notice that not all of the reads are the same length now, as they have had the illumina adapters cut out of them and they\u2019ve been quality trimmed.\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Assemble reads into contigs with Velvet and the Velvet Optimiser\n\n\nThe aim here is to assemble the trimmed reads into contigs/scaffolds using Velvet and the Velvet Optimiser.\n\n\nWe will use a single tool, Velvet Optimiser, which takes the trimmed reads from Trimmomatic and performs numerous Velvet assemblies to find the best one. We need to add the reads in two separate libraries. One for the still paired reads and the other for the singleton reads orphaned from their pairs by the trimming process.\n\n\nClick here for a more detailed explanation of Velvet assemblies and the Velvet Optimiser\n\n\nDe novo assembly of the reads into contigs\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tools menu in the left hand panel of Galaxy, select \nNGS: Assembly -\n Velvet Optimiser\n and run with these parameters (only the non-default selections are listed here):\n\n\n\"Start k-mer value\": \n55\n\n\n\"End k-mer value\": \n69\n\n\nIn the input files section:\n\n\n\"Select first set of reads\": \nTrimmomatic on data 2 and data 1 (R1 paired)\n\n\n\"Select second set of reads\": \nTrimmomatic on data 2 and data 1 (R2 paired)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nInsert Input Files\n button and add the following:\n\n\n\"Single or paired end reads\": \nSingle\n\n\n\"Select the reads\": \nTrimmomatic on data 2 and data 1 (R1 unpaired)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the above process to add the other unpaired read set \nTrimmomatic on data 2 and data 1 (R2 unpaired)\n as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Screenshot of Velvet Optimiser inputs in Galaxy\n\n\n\n\nExamine assembly output\n\n\nOnce step 1 is complete, you should now have 2 new objects in your history:\n\n \nVelvetOptimiser on data 9, data 7, and others: Contigs\n\n\n \nVelvetOptimiser on data 9, data 7, and others: Contig Stats\n\n\nClick on the \n icon of the various objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigs: You\u2019ll see the first MB of the file. Note that the contigs are named NODE_XX_length_XXXX_cov_XXX.XXX. This information tells you how long (in k-mer length) each contig is and what it\u2019s average k-mer coverage is. (See detailed explanation of Velvet and Velvet Optimiser for explanation of k-mer coverage and k-mer length.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContig stats: This shows a table of the contigs and their k-mer coverages and which read library contributed to the coverage. It is interesting to note that some of them have much higher coverage than the average. These are most likely to be repeated contigs. (Things like ribosomal RNA and IS elements.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Screenshot of assembled contigs (a) and contig stats (b)\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\nCalculate some statistics on the assembled contigs\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tools menu in the left hand panel of Galaxy, select \nFASTA Manipulation -\n Fasta Statistics\n and run with these parameters:\n\n\n\"Fasta or multifasta file\": \nVelvet Optimiser ... Contigs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\nExamine the Fasta Stats output\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have one more object in your history: \nFasta Statistics on data 10: Fasta summary stats\n\n\nClick on the \n icon next to this object and have a look at the output. You\u2019ll see a statistical summary of the contigs including various length stats, the % GC content, the n50 as well as the number of contigs and the number of N bases contained in them.\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Extension.\n\n\nExamine the contig coverage depth and blast a high coverage contig against a protein database.\n\n\nExamine the contig coverage depth.\n\n\nLook at the Contig Stats data (Velvet Optimiser vlsci on data 8, data 9, and data 7: Contig stats) by clicking on the \n icon. Note that column 2 contig length (lgth), shows a number of very short contigs (some are length 1).\n\n\n\n\nWe can easily filter out these short contigs from this information list by using the \nFilter and Sort -\n Filter tool.\n\n\nSet the following:\n\n\n\"Filter\": \nVelvet Optimiser on data 8, data 7 and others: Contig stats\n\n\n\"With the following condition\": \nc2 \n 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nThe new data object in the history is called: \nFilter on data 11\n.\n\n\nClick on its \n icon to view it. Look through the list taking note of the coverages. Note that the average of the coverages (column 6) seems to be somewhere between 16 and 32.  There are a lot of contigs with coverage 16. We could say that these contigs only appear once in the genome of the bacteria. Therefore, contigs with double this coverage would appear twice. Note that some of the coverages are \n400! These contigs will appear in the genome more than 20 times!\n\n\nLets have a look at one of these contigs and see if we can find out what it is.\n\n\nExtract a single sequence from the contigs file.\n\n\nNote the contig number (column 1 in the Contig stats file) of a contig with a coverage of over 300. There should be a few of them. We need to extract the fasta sequence of this contig from the contigs multifasta so we can see it more easily.\n\n\nTo do this we will use the tool:\n\n\n\n\nFasta manipulation -\n Fasta Extract Sequence\n\n\nSet the following:\n\n\n\"Fasta or multifasta file\": \nVelvet Optimiser ... : Contigs\n\n\n\"Sequence ID (or partial): \nNODE_1_...\n (for example)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nThe new data object in the history is called: \nFasta Extract Sequence on data 10: Fasta\n.\n\n\nClick on its \n icon to view it. It is a single sequence in fasta format.\n\n\nBlast sequence to determine what it contains.\n\n\nWe want to find out what this contig is or what kind of coding sequence (if any) it contains. So we will blast the sequence using the NCBI blast website. (External to Galaxy). To do this:\n\n\n\n\nBring up the sequence of the contig into the main window of the browser by clicking on the \n icon if it isn\u2019t already.\n\n\nSelect the entire sequence by clicking and dragging with the mouse or by pressing ctrl-a in the browser.\n\n\nCopy the selected sequence to the clipboard.\n\n\nOpen a new tab of your browser and point it to: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi\n\n\nUnder the BASIC BLAST section, click \u201cblastx\u201d.\n\n\nPaste the sequence into the large text box labelled: Enter Accession number(s), gi(s) or FASTA sequence(s).\n\n\nChange the Genetic code to: Bacteria and Archaea (11)\n\n\nClick the button labelled: BLAST\n\n\n\n\nAfter a while the website will present a report of the blast run. Note that the sequence we blasted (if you chose NODE_1) is identical to part of a transposase gene (IS256) from a similar Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. These transposases occur frequently as repeats in bacterial genomes and so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised at its very high coverage.\n\n\nFigure 6: Screenshot of the output from the NCBI Blast website",

The data for this tutorial is from a whole genome sequencing experiment of a multi-drug resistant strain of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The DNA was sequenced using an Illumina GAII sequencing machine. The data we are going to use consists of about 4 million x 75 base-pair, paired end reads (two FASTQ read files, one for each end of a DNA fragment.) The data was downloaded from the  NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA)  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/). The specific sample is a public dataset published in April 2012 with SRA accession number ERR048396.  We will also use a FASTA file containing the sequences of the Illumina adapters used in the sequencing process. It is desirable to remove these as they are artificial sequences and not part of the bacterium that was sequenced.  We will use software called  Velvet  (Zerbino et al 2008) for the main de novo assembly, as well as some other peripheral software for pre- and post-processing of the data. Details of these can be found in the background document linked above.  The protocol:  We are performing a de novo assembly of the read data into contigs and then into scaffolds (appropriately positioned contigs loosely linked together). We firstly need to check the quality of the input data as this will help us choose the most appropriate range of input parameters for the assembly and will guide us on an appropriate quality trimming/cleanup strategy. We will then use an iterative method to assemble the reads using the  Velvet Optimiser  (a program that performs lots of Velvet assemblies searching for an optimum outcome.) Once this is complete we will obtain summary statistics on the final results (contigs) of the assembly.  Follow this  link for an overview of the protocol  The protocol in a nutshell:  Input:  Raw reads from sequencer run on microbial DNA sample.

Essentially, you upload your files, create various analysis pipelines and run them, then visualise your results.\n\n\nGalaxy is really an interface to the various tools that do the data processing; each of these tools could be run from the command line, outside of Galaxy. Galaxy makes it easier to link up the tools together and visualise the entire analysis pipeline.\n\n\nGalaxy uses the concept of 'histories'. Histories are sets of data and workflows that act on that data. The data for this workshop is available in a shared history, which you can import into your own Galaxy account\n\n\nLearn more about Galaxy here\n\n\nFigure 1: The Galaxy interface\n\n\nTools on the left, data in the middle, analysis workflow on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe novo assembly with Velvet and the Velvet Optimiser.\n\n\nVelvet\n\n\nVelvet is software to perform dna assembly from short reads by manipulating de Bruijn graphs. It is capable of forming long contigs (n50 of in excess of 150kb) from paired end short reads. It has several input parameters for controlling the structure of the de Bruijn graph and these must be set optimally to get the best assembly possible. Velvet can read Fasta, FastQ, sam or bam files. However, it ignores any quality scores and simply relies on sequencing depth to resolve errors. The Velvet Optimiser software performs many Velvet assemblies with various parameter sets and searches for the optimal assembly automatically.\n\n\nde Bruijn graphs\n\n\nA de Bruijn graph is a directed graph which represents overlaps between sequences of symbols. The size of the sequence contained in the nodes of the graph is called the word-length or k-mer size. In Figure 2, the word length is 3. The two symbols are 1 and 0. Each node in the graph has the last two symbols of the previous node and 1 new symbol. Sequences of symbols can be produced by traversing the graph and adding the \u201cnew\u201d symbol to the growing sequence.\n\n\nFigure 2: A de Bruijn graph of word length 3 for the symbols 1 and 0.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2015/02/28/1247/\n\n\nVelvet constructs a de Bruijn graph of the reads. It has 4 symbols (A, C, G and T - N\u2019s are converted to A\u2019s) The word length (or k-mer size) is one of Velvet\u2019s prime parameters.\n\n\nVelvet is not the only assembly software that works in this manner. Euler, Edena and SOAP de novo are examples of others.\n\n\nThe Velvet algorithm\n\n\nStep 1: Hashing the reads.\n\n\n\n\nVelvet breaks up each read into k-mers of length k.\n\n\nA k-mer is a k length subsequence of the read.\n\n\nA 36 base pair long read would have 6 different 31-mers.\n\n\nThe k-mers and their reverse complements are added to a hash table to categorize them.\n\n\nEach k-mer is stored once but the number of times it appears is also recorded.\n\n\nThis step is performed by \u201cvelveth\u201d - one of the programs in the Velvet suite.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Constructing the de Bruijn graph.\n\n\n\n\nVelvet adds the k-mers one-by-one to the graph.\n\n\nAdjacent k-mers overlap by k-1 nucleotides.\n\n\nA k-mer which has no k-1 overlaps with any k-mer already on the graph starts a new node.\n\n\nEach node stores the average number of times its k-mers appear in the hash table.\n\n\nFigure 3 shows a section of a de Bruijn graph constructed by Velvet for k=5.\n\n\nDifferent sequences can be read off the graph by following a different path through it. (Figure 3)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Section of a simple de Bruijn graph of reads with k-mer size 5. Coloured sequences are constructed by following the appropriately coloured line through the graph.\n \n(Base figure Zerbino et al 2008.)\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Simplification of the graph.\n\n\n\n\nChain merging: When there are two connected nodes in the graph without a divergence, merge the two nodes.\n\n\nTip clipping: Tips are short (typically) chains of nodes that are disconnected on one end. They will be clipped if their length is \n 2 x k or their average k-mer depth is much less than the continuing path.\n\n\nBubble removal: Bubbles are redundant paths that start and end at the same nodes (Figure 4.) They are created by sequencing errors, biological variants or slightly varying repeat sequences.\n\n\nVelvet compares the paths using dynamic programming.\n\n\nIf they are highly similar, the paths are merged.\n\n\nError removal: Erroneous connections are removed by using a \u201ccoverage cutoff\u201d. Genuine short nodes which cannot be simplified should have a high coverage. An attempt is made to resolve repeats using the \u201cexpected coverage\u201d of the graph nodes.\n\n\nPaired end read information: Velvet uses algorithms called \u201cPebble\u201d and \u201cRock Band\u201d (Zerbino et al 2009) to order the nodes with respect to one another in order to scaffold them into longer contigs.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Representation of \u201cbubbles\u201d in a Velvet de Bruijn graph.\n  \n(Base figure Zerbino et al 2008.)\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Read off the contigs.\n\n\n\n\nFollow the chains of nodes through the graph and \u201cread off\u201d the bases to create the contigs.\n\n\nWhere there is an ambiguous divergence/convergence, stop the current contig and start a new one.\n\n\n\n\nK-mer size and coverage cutoff values\n\n\nThe size of the k-mers that construct the graph is very important and has a large effect on the outcome of the assembly. Generally, small k-mers create a graph with increased connectivity, more ambiguity (more divergences) and less clear \u201cpaths\u201d through the graph. Large k-mers produce graphs with less connectivity but higher specificity. The paths through the graph are clearer but they are less connected and prone to breaking down.\n\n\nThe coverage cutoff c used during the error correction step of Velvet also has a significant effect on the output of the assembly process. If c is too low, the assembly will contain nodes of the graph that are the product of sequencing errors and misconnections. If c is too high, it can create mis-assemblies in the contigs and destroys lots of useful data.\n\n\nEach dataset has its own optimum values for the k-mer size and the coverage cutoff used in the error removal step. Choosing them appropriately is one of the challenges faced by new users of the Velvet software.\n\n\nVelvet Optimiser\n\n\nThe Velvet Optimiser chooses the optimal values for k and c automatically by performing many runs of Velvet (partially in parallel) and interrogating the subsequent assemblies.  It uses different optimisation functions for k and c and these can be user controlled.\n\n\nIt requires the user to input a range of k values to search (to cut down on running time).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly\n\n\nZerbino DR, Birney E, Velvet: algorithms for de novo short read assembly using de Bruijn graphs, Genome Research, 2008, 18:821-829\n\n\nZerbino DR, McEwen GK, Margulies EH, Birney E, Pebble and rock band: heuristic resolution of repeats and scaffolding in the velvet short-read de novo assembler.

Generally, small k-mers create a graph with increased connectivity, more ambiguity (more divergences) and less clear \u201cpaths\u201d through the graph. Large k-mers produce graphs with less connectivity but higher specificity. The paths through the graph are clearer but they are less connected and prone to breaking down.  The coverage cutoff c used during the error correction step of Velvet also has a significant effect on the output of the assembly process. If c is too low, the assembly will contain nodes of the graph that are the product of sequencing errors and misconnections. If c is too high, it can create mis-assemblies in the contigs and destroys lots of useful data.  Each dataset has its own optimum values for the k-mer size and the coverage cutoff used in the error removal step. Choosing them appropriately is one of the challenges faced by new users of the Velvet software.",

Get started\n\n\nYour workshop trainers will provide you with the address of a virtual machine. \n\n\nMac users\n\n\nOpen the Terminal. \n\n\n\n\nType in \n\n\n\n\nssh researcher@[your virtual machine address]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in the password provided. \n\n\n\n\nWindows users\n\n\nIf you are using Windows 10, you might be able to use the Ubuntu Subsystem. Otherwise, install and open Putty. \n\n\n\n\nDownload putty \nhere\n.\n\n\nOpen. A configuration window will appear. \n\n\nUnder \"Host Name (or IP address)\" enter in the address of your virtual machine. \n\n\nUnder \"Port\" type in 22\n\n\nUnder \"Connection Type\" select \"SSH\"\n\n\nClick \"Open\"\n\n\nUnder \"Login as:\" enter \"researcher\"\n\n\nType in the password provided. \n\n\n\n\nActivate the conda environment\n\n\nType in:\n\n\nsource /mnt/gvl/apps/conda/bin/activate\n\n\n\n\n(This points us to some different directories for the software we need). \n\n\nCreate a new working directory on your remote computer.\n\n\nBecause we are starting a new analysis it is always good practice to start in a new empty directory. Therefore, we will create a new directory and change to it for the rest of the workshop.\n\n\nIn your terminal:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new directory called \"Workshop\"\n\n\n\n\nmkdir Workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange to that directory\n\n\n\n\ncd Workshop\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Every time you open a new terminal or Putty session, you will need to make sure you are in this directory again.\n\n\nFind your current directory by typing:\n\n\npwd\n\n\n\n\n2. Get data\n\n\nThe sample used in this tutorial is from a bacteria called \nStaphylococcus aureus\n. We have used a small section of its real genome so that the programs can run in the workshop time. \n\n\nThe files we need are:\n\n\n\n\npacbio.fq\n: the PacBio reads\n\n\nR1.fq\n: the Illumina forward reads\n\n\nR2.fq\n: the Illumina reverse reads\n\n\n\n\nIn a new tab, go to \nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1009308\n. \n\n\n\n\nNext to the first file, right-click (or control-click) the \"Download\" button, and select \"Copy link address\".\n\n\nBack in your terminal, enter \n\n\n\n\nwget [paste file link here]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file should download. \n\n\nNote:\n paste the link to the file, not to the webpage.\n\n\nRepeat this for the other two files. \n\n\n\n\n3. Assemble\n\n\nWe will use the assembly software called \nCanu\n, version 1.7.\n\n\nRun Canu with these commands:\n\n\ncanu -p canu -d canu_outdir genomeSize=0.03m corThreads=3 -pacbio-raw pacbio.fq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe first \ncanu\n tells the program to run\n\n\n-p canu\n names prefix for output files (\"canu\")\n\n\n-d canu_outdir\n names output directory (\"canu_outdir\")\n\n\ngenomeSize\n only has to be approximate. (In this case we are using a partial genome of expected size 30,000 base pairs). \n\n\ncorThreads=3\n sets the number of available threads. \n\n\nCanu will correct, trim and assemble the reads.\n\n\nVarious output will be displayed on the screen.\n\n\nNote\n: Canu could say \"Finished\" but may still be running. In this case, type \nsqueue\n to see if jobs are still running. \n\n\n\n\nIf you run \nsqueue\n you will see something like this:\n\n\n             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n                 6      main canu_can research PD       0:00      1 (Dependency)\n               5_1      main cormhap_ research  R       0:29      1 master\n\n\n\n\nYou will know if \nCanu\n has completely finished when \nsqueue\n shows no jobs listed under the header row. \n\n\n4. Check assembly output\n\n\nMove into the canu output folder: \n\n\ncd canu_outdir\n\n\n\n\nView the list of files: \n\n\nls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncanu.contigs.fasta\n are the assembled sequences.\n\n\nThe \ncanu.unassembled.fasta\n are the reads that could not be assembled.\n\n\nThe \ncanu.correctedReads.fasta.gz\n are the corrected Pacbio reads that were used in the assembly.\n\n\nThe \ncanu.contigs.gfa\n is the graph of the assembly.\n\n\nThe \ncanu.report\n file is a summary of all of the steps Canu performed with information about the reads used, how they were handled and a whole lot of summary information about the assembly.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay summary information about the contigs: (\ninfoseq\n is a tool from \nEMBOSS\n)\n\n\ninfoseq canu.contigs.fasta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will show the contigs found by Canu. e.g.,  tig00000001  42107\n\n\n\"tig00000001\" is the name given to the contig\n\n\n\"42107\" is the number of base pairs in that contig.\n\n\n\n\nThis matches what we were expecting for this sample (approximately 30,000 base pairs). For other data, Canu may not be able to join all the reads into one contig, so there may be several contigs in the output.\n\n\nWe should also look at the \ncanu.report\n. To do this:\n\n\nless canu.report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"less\" is a command to display the file on the screen.\n\n\nUse the up and down arrows to scroll up and down. \n\n\nYou will see lots of histograms of read lengths before and after processing, final contig construction, etc. \n\n\nFor a description of the outputs that Canu produces, see: \nhttp://canu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#outputs\n\n\nType \nq\n to exit viewing the report. \n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nHow do long- and short-read assembly methods differ?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nShort reads are usually assembled with De Bruijn graphs. For long reads, there is a move back towards simpler overlap-layout-consensus methods.\n\n\n\nWhere can we find out the what the approximate genome size should be for the species being assembled?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nGo to NCBI Genomes, enter species name, click on Genome Assembly and Annotation report, sort table by clicking on the column header Size (Mb), look at range of sizes in this column.\n\n\n\nIn the assembly output, what are the unassembled reads? \n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nReads and low-coverage contigs that were not used in the assembly.\n\n\n\nWhat are the corrected reads? How did canu correct the reads?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nCanu builds overlaps between reads. The consensus is used to correct the reads. \n\n\n\nWhere could you view the output .gfa and what would it show?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nA useful program is \nBandage\n. If the assembly has multiple contigs, the assembly graph shows how these are connected. \n\n\n\n5. Trim and circularise\n\n\nBacteria have circular chromosomes. \n\n\n\n\nBecause of sequencing errors, there may be some \"overhang\" in the assembled linear sequence. \n\n\nOur assembly may have some overhang because it is 9000 bases longer than expected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapted from Figure 1. Hunt et al. Genome Biology 2015\n\n\nA tool called \nCirclator\n identifies and trims overhangs (on chromosomes and plasmids). It takes in the assembled contigs from Canu, as well as the corrected reads prepared by Canu.\n\n\nMove back into your main analysis folder: \n\n\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\nRun Circlator\n\n\ncirclator all --threads 4 --verbose canu_outdir/canu.contigs.fasta canu_outdir/canu.correctedReads.fasta.gz circlator_outdir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Click on the dark grey slider bar above and move it to the right, to see all the way to the end of the line.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--threads\n is the number of cores\n\n\n\n\n--verbose\n prints progress information to the screen\n\n\ncanu_outdir/canu.contigs.fasta\n is the file path to the input Canu assembly\n\n\ncanu_outdir/canu.correctedReads.fasta.gz\n is the file path to the corrected Pacbio reads - note, fastA not fastQ\n\n\ncirclator_outdir\n is the name of the output directory.\n\n\n\n\nSome output will print to screen. When finished, it should say \"Circularized x of x contig(s)\".\n\n\nCheck the output\n\n\nMove into the Circlator output directory: \n\n\ncd circlator_outdir\n\n\n\n\nList the files: \n\n\nls\n\n\n\n\nCirclator has named the output files with numbers as prefixes. \n\n\nWere the contigs circularised?\n\n\nless 04.merge.circularise.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"less\" is a command to display the file on the screen.\n\n\n04.merge.circularise.log\n is the name of the file. \n\n\nYes, the contig was circularised (last column).\n\n\nType \nq\n to exit.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the trimmed contig sizes? \n\n\ninfoseq 06.fixstart.fasta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contig \"tig00000001\" has a length of 30019.\n\n\nThis is about 12,000 bases shorter than before circularisation. This was the \"overhang\" and has now been trimmed. \n\n\n\n\nCopy the circularised contigs file to the main analysis directory with a new name:\n\n\ncp 06.fixstart.fasta ../contig1.fasta\n\n\n\n\nMove back into the main folder: \n\n\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWere all the contigs circularised? \n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nIn this example, yes, the contig was circularised.\n\n\n\nCirclator can set the start of the sequence at a particular gene. Which gene does it use? Is this appropriate for all contigs?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nCirclator uses dnaA (if present) for the chromosomal contig.

One option is the program called Unicycler which may automate many of these steps. https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler\n\n\n\n7. Correct the assembly\n\n\nSequences from PacBio can have more errors than those from Illumina. Therefore, although it is useful to use the long PacBio reads to assemble the genome, we can also use the shorter and more accurate Illumina reads to correct errors in the PacBio assembly. \n\n\nMake an alignment file\n\n\nIndex the fasta file:\n\n\nbwa index genome.fasta\n\n\n\n\nAlign the Illumina reads:\n\n\nbwa mem -t 4 genome.fasta R1.fq R2.fq | samtools sort \n pilon_aln.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAligns Illumina \nR1.fq\n and \nR2.fq\n to the PacBio assembly \ngenome.fasta\n. \n\n\nThis produces a .bam file\n\n\n|\n pipes the output to samtools to sort (required for downstream processing)\n\n\n pilon_aln.bam\n redirects the sorted bam to this file\n\n\n\n\nIndex the files:\n\n\nsamtools index pilon_aln.bam\n\n\n\n\nsamtools faidx genome.fasta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have an alignment file to use  with the tool \nPilon\n: \npilon_aln.bam\n\n\n\n\nRun Pilon\n\n\nRun:\n\n\npilon --genome genome.fasta --frags pilon_aln.bam --output pilon1 --fix all --mindepth 0.5 --changes --verbose --threads 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--genome\n is the name of the input assembly to be corrected\n\n\n--frags\n is the alignment of the reads against the assembly\n\n\n--output\n is the name of the output prefix\n\n\n--fix\n is an option for types of corrections\n\n\n--mindepth\n gives a minimum read depth to use\n\n\n--changes\n produces an output file of the changes made\n\n\n--verbose\n prints information to the screen during the run\n\n\n--threads\n: number of cores\n\n\n\n\nLook at the changes file: \n\n\nless pilon1.changes\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see lots of cases where a deletion (represented by a dot) has been corrected to a base.  \n\n\nType \nq\n to exit. \n\n\n\n\nLook at the details of the fasta file: \n\n\ninfoseq pilon1.fasta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchromosome - 30059 (net +40 bases)\n\n\nplasmid - 2252 (no change)\n\n\n\n\nChange the file name: \n\n\ncp pilon1.fasta assembly.fasta\n\n\n\n\nWe now have the corrected genome assembly of \nStaphylococcus aureus\n in .fasta format, containing a chromosome and a small plasmid.  \n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWhy don't we correct earlier in the assembly process?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nWe need to circularise the contigs and trim overhangs first.\n\n\n\nWhy can we use some reads (Illumina) to correct other reads (PacBio) ?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nIllumina reads have higher accuracy.\n\n\n\nCould we just use PacBio reads to assemble the genome?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nYes, if accuracy adequate.\n\n\n\n8. Comparative Genomics\n\n\nIn the workshop so far, we used a partial bacterial genome so that the exercises could run in the time available. As a demonstration, to better see the effect of long and short reads on the assembly, we will examine a complete bacterial genome. \n\n\nAssemblies\n\n\nThis bacterial genome has been assembled from either long PacBio reads (using Canu) or shorter Illumina reads (using Spades). \n\n\nAssembly graphs:\n\n\nLook at the assembly graph (usually has a suffix .gfa), in the program \nBandage\n. This shows how contigs are related, albeit with ambiguity in some places.\n\n\nThe assembly graph from Illumina reads (Spades assembly):\n\n\n\n\nThe assembly graph from PacBio reads (Canu assembly) - this is missing the small plasmid:\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that the long read data results in a more contiguous assembly - one complete chromosome versus many smaller contigs with ambiguous placement. \n\n\nDoes it matter that an assembly is in many contigs?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nYes and No. Yes: broken genes can lead to missing/incorrect annotations; fragmented assemblies provide less information about the genomic structure (\ne.g.\n the number of plasmids) and the location of genes of interest (\ne.g.\n gene A is located on plasmid X). No: many or all genes may still be annotated correctly. Gene location is useful (e.g. chromosome, plasmid1) but not always essential (e.g. presence/absence of particular resistance genes may be enough information).\n\n\n\nAnnotations\n\n\nGenomic features such as genes can be identified with annotation tools. We have used a tool called \nProkka\n to annotate the two genomes described above. \n\n\nSome of the output data is displayed here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassembly:\n\n\nPacBio\n\n\nIllumina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize\n\n\n2,825,804\n\n\n2,792,905\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontigs\n\n\n2\n\n\n123\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDS\n\n\n2614\n\n\n2575\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntRNA\n\n\n61\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrRNA\n\n\n19\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are there more CDS identified in the PacBio assembly? \n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nThe PacBio assembly may have errors (usually a one base indel) which will cause a frame shift, which can result in three things: a longer CDS, a shorter CDS, or a shorter CDS plus an additional CDS. In addition, the Illumina assembly is about 33 kb smaller than the PacBio assembly. In bacteria, a rule of thumb is that 1 kb is roughly equal to one gene. Thus, we would probably expect about 33 fewer identified genes, which fits with these results.\n\n\n\n\nWhy are there more rRNA identified in the PacBio assembly? \n\n\n\n\nAnswer (click to reveal)\n\nThere may be multiple copies of the rRNAs and these could have been collapsed as repeats in the Illumina assembly. \n\n\n\n9.

The process is referred to as \"protein database search\" or even \"protein sequencing\", although amino acid sequences are not obtained \nde novo\n with this method.\n\n\nThe data used in this tutorial were obtained from a single run on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer.  The sample itself corresponds to a purified organelle from Mouse cells.  \n\n\nThe aim of the tutorial will be to create a list of all proteins that can be confidently said to be present in the sample, and then to use this list to guess the identity of the \"mystery\" organelle.\n\n\nThis tutorial uses free software including;\n\n\n\n\nThe \nX!Tandem\n search engine\n\n\nThe \nTrans Proteomic Pipeline\n (TPP) for post-search validation\n\n\nThe \nProtk\n tool suite for various conversion tasks and to make working with X!Tandem and the TPP easier\n\n\nThe \nGalaxy\n platform to bring all these tools together\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a browser and go to a Galaxy server.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a galaxy server of your own \nor\n\n\nGalaxy Tute\n at genome.edu.au\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Use a supported browser.

These two types of measurements are called \nMS\n and \nMS/MS\n spectra respectively.  The following schematic shows how an \nMS/MS\n scan results from the fragmentation of a selected product ion.  Often multiple \nMS/MS\n spectra are obtained for each \nMS\n scan, selecting different precursor masses each time so that as many peptides as possible can be analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nNumber of spectra:\n\n\nClick the eye icon on the history item to view the \nmzML\n file as text.

Looking closely you should see that this text appears once for every \nMS1\n spectrum in the file (plus it occurs one extra time at the top of the file as part of the file description).  The file is large though and the browser can only see the first megabyte of it. \n\n\nNow search for the text \"spectrumList count\". It should bring you to a line in the file that says spectrumList count=\"24941\".

Future exercises use the same technique so you might find it useful to create a tiny workflow to automate this proceedure. \nSee the instructions here\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the development of tandem mass spectrometry, peptides and proteins were detected purely by matching \nMS\n peaks against the masses of whole peptides via \nPeptide Mass Fingerprinting\n.  This has largely been superceded by tandem mass spectrometry which gains much greater specificity by using the \nMS/MS\n spectra.  In this tutorial only the \nMS/MS\n spectra will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3) How many \nMS/MS\n spectra are there in this dataset?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nUse the fact that the file contains a total of 24941 spectra with your answer to the previous question about \nMS\n spectra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink8\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable8\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21799\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink9\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable9\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\nAlternate data formats\n\n\nAnother format you are likely to encounter for tandem mass spectrometry data is \nMascot Generic Format\n or \nmgf\n.  Mascot Generic Format (\nmgf\n) is the data file format preferred by the \nMascot\n search engine.  It is a text based format is much easier to read by hand than the \nmzML\n file.  Each spectrum appears between \"BEGIN IONS\" and \"END IONS\" statements and simply consists of (\nmz\n,\nintensity\n) pairs.  Additional summary information about the precursor (whole peptide) ion such as its mass, retention time and charge are included. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Organelle Sample data in \nmgf\n format\n\n\nUse the \nPaste/Fetch data\n tool again and paste the following URL into the box that appears.

Try to get a feel for the way data is organised within the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4) How many spectra are there in this dataset and what type of spectra do you think they are?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nUse the same technique you used for the previous exercise (or your workflow). Remember that for every spectrum there is one \"BEGIN IONS\" statement in the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n \n- and here to show more\n\n\n\n\nConsider your answers to questions 3 and 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink12\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable12\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n            if ($(\"#showable12\").hasClass(\"showable-hidden\")) {\n                $(\"#showablelink12\").text(\"More\");\n            } else {\n                $(\"#showablelink12\").text(\"Less\");\n            }\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink11\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable11\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21799\n\n\nMS/MS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink13\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable13\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\nObtain a Search Database\n\n\nSetting up a search database is a critical step.  For this tutorial we have created a database for you, but if you need to create a database for your own data you'll need to consider the following key issues;\n\n\n\n\nDatabase size\n\n\nWhether to include decoys\n\n\nWhat types of variants to include if any\n\n\nHow to format your database identifiers\n\n\n\n\nMore details are provided \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload a database of Mouse proteins in \nfasta\n format\n\n\nUse the \nPaste/Fetch data\n tool again and paste the following URL into the box that appears.  Then click \nStart\n to initiate the download.\n\n\nhttps://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v2/AUTH_ffb00634530a4c37a0b8b08c48068adf/proteomics_tutorial/UniprotMouseD_20140716.fasta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspect the first few items in the database in Galaxy.  The file is in \nFasta\n format which means that each entry has a single description line that starts with a \"\n\" followed by a unique identifier and then some general descriptive information.  The actual sequence of amino acids is given after the description line. Take note of the format of the database identifiers. They are in Uniprot format and look like this;\n\n\nsp|Q9CQV8|1433B_MOUSE\n\n\n\nThe database also includes decoy sequences, appended at the end.  They have identifiers like this;\n\n\ndecoy_rp75404\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5) What is the ratio of decoys to non-decoys in the database?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nDecoys are easiest to search for because they all start with \"decoy_\". The total number of database entries can be found simply expanding the fasta file in your history (by clicking on its title).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink15\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable15\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink16\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable16\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\nRun a search using X!Tandem\n\n\nA large number of search engines now exist for proteomics data.  This exercise uses \nX!Tandem\n which is one of the fastest and most widely used. Other search engines include \nOMSSA\n, \nMS-GF+\n and \nMascot\n.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nX!Tandem Search\n tool\n\n\nEnter parameters as shown in the table below (leave all others at their defaults)\n\n\nClick Execute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Name\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUploaded Fasta File\n\n\nUniprotMouseD_20140716.fasta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSMS File\n\n\nOrganelleSample.mgf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Modifications\n\n\nOxidation M\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed Modifications\n\n\nCarbamidomethyl C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissed Cleavages Allowed\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnzyme\n\n\nTrypsin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragment Ion Tolerance\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecursor Ion Tolerance\n\n\n10 ppm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search should run for about 5-10 minutes and will produce an output file in \nX!Tandem\n xml format. A much more useful format is \npepXML\n so the next step in the analysis will be to run a tool to convert from tandem to pepXML.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nTandem to pepXML\n tool\n\n\nSelect the output from the previous step as input and click \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nWhile the search is running, read some background theory on \nhow search engine's work\n.\n\n\nConvert Results to tabular format\n\n\nAlthough the \npepXML\n format is useful as input to other tools it is not designed to be read or analyzed directly. Galaxy includes a tool to convert \npepXML\n into tabular (tab separated) format, which is much easier to read.  Tabular format also has the advantage that it can be downloaded and opened using many other programs including \nExcel\n and \nR\n.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \npepXML to Table\n tool\n\n\nSelect the \npepXML\n file produced in the previous step as input and click \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nTo get the most out of tabular files it is often necessary to know the column number corresponding to columns of interest.  Explore the column assignments in your tabular file by clicking on its title in your galaxy history.  This will show extra details about the item, including a handy preview where column numbers are displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6) In what column number is the \nassumed_charge\n of peptides in the \npepXML\n tabular file?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink18\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable18\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\nSort tabular outputs\n\n\nExamine the tabular output file from the previous step.  It contains many columns, of which the most interesting are probably the raw search engine score and the name of the protein from which each peptide has been derived. Note the presence of plenty of decoy proteins among the results.  These decoys should tend to have quite poor scores compared with real hits.  The \nraw score\n for \nX!Tandem\n searches is an \nE-value\n.  To push these decoys to the bottom of the list we can sort the data by \nraw score\n. \n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nSort\n data tool from the \nFilter and Sort\n menu in the left pane of Galaxy\n\n\nChoose to sort on \nraw_score\n.  This is column c10 \n\n\nSelect \nAscending order\n for the sort direction (small E-values are good) and click \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the resulting dataset.  The top of the file should now have very few decoys.\n\n\nConvert raw scores to probabilities\n\n\nRaw \nX!Tandem\n scores only give a rough estimate of the reliability of each peptide to spectrum match (PSM). A better estimate can be obtained by running a tool that uses global statistical properties of the search to assign a probability to each PSM of being correct.  A number of tools exist for this, and in this tutorial we use \nPeptide Prophet\n, which can work with a wide variety of different search engine scoring systems. It is extremely useful as it effectively converts disparate scores to the common scale of probability. The probabilities produced by \nPeptide Prophet\n can be used to set a threshold for acceptance.  For example we could decide to accept only PSM's with a probability greater than 0.95. Note that this is not the same as the False Discovery Rate which is computed by taking (1-p) for all the accepted PSM's and dividing by the total number of accepted PSM's. A widely used alternative to \nPeptide Prophet\n is \nPercolator\n.\n\n\nIf you're curious about how \nPeptide Prophet\n works, take a look at \nthis explainer\n, or \nthe original paper\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nPeptide Prophet\n tool\n\n\nSelect the \nX!Tandem\n output in \npepXML\n format generated earlier as input\n\n\nCheck the box that says \nUse decoys to pin down the negative distribution\n.\n\n\nConvert the resulting \npepXML\n file to tabular using the \nPepXML to Table\n tool\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the resulting tabular file.  Note that this time the \npeptideprophet_prob\n column is populated and contains numbers between 0 and 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7) How many PSM's have a peptideprophet probability greater than or equal to 0.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nUse the \nFilter\n tool from the \nFilter and Sort\n submenu. Also remember that Peptide Prophet probability is given in a column called \npeptideprophet_prob\n.

Each of the peptides observed will have come from a protein sequence in the \nfasta\n file that we used as a database, and this protein is recorded along with the \nPSM\n itself in all of the result tables we've viewed so far.  Unfortunately, the process of inferring the existence of proteins based on these \nPSMs\n is much more complicated than that because some peptides are found in more than one protein, and of course some proteins are supported by more than one \nPSM\n.\n\n\nThe \nProtein Prophet\n tool can be used to run a proper protein inference analysis, and assigns probabilities to individual proteins, as well as groups of related proteins.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nProtein Prophet\n tool\n\n\nChoose the \npepXML\n formatted output from \nPeptide Prophet\n as input and click \nExecute\n\n\nConvert the resulting \nprotXML\n to tabular using the \nprotXML to Table\n tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9) How many proteins are there with protein prophet probability greater than or equal to 0.99?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nFilter on column 6 \nprotein_probability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink28\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable28\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n601\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink29\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable29\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n    \n\n\nIf you have time, read over \nthese notes\n on the Protein Prophet output.

The basic idea is to match tandem ms spectra obtained from a sample with equivalent theoretical spectra from a reference protein database.

The data used in this tutorial were obtained from a single run on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer.  The sample itself corresponds to a purified organelle from Mouse cells.    The aim of the tutorial will be to create a list of all proteins that can be confidently said to be present in the sample, and then to use this list to guess the identity of the \"mystery\" organelle.

This will toggle display of some additional information about the data.     \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink1\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable1\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n        Answer    mzML      \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink2\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable2\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n      MS versus MS/MS:  A key feature of  Tandem  mass spectrometry is the acquisition of mass spectra (spectra) that measure the masses of precursor ions (whole peptides) as well as spectra that measure the fragment masses of a single selected peptide.  These two types of measurements are called  MS  and  MS/MS  spectra respectively.  The following schematic shows how an  MS/MS  scan results from the fragmentation of a selected product ion.  Often multiple  MS/MS  spectra are obtained for each  MS  scan, selecting different precursor masses each time so that as many peptides as possible can be analyzed.   Number of spectra:  Click the eye icon on the history item to view the  mzML  file as text.  The file is almost impossible to read by hand but with some text searching we will be able to deduce the number of  MS  and  MS/MS  spectra in the file.  Now try searching for the text \"MS1 spectrum\" in the page using your web browser's search function.  Looking closely you should see that this text appears once for every  MS1  spectrum in the file (plus it occurs one extra time at the top of the file as part of the file description).  The file is large though and the browser can only see the first megabyte of it.   Now search for the text \"spectrumList count\". It should bring you to a line in the file that says spectrumList count=\"24941\".  There are a total of 24941 spectra in the entire file including both  MS  and  MS/MS  spectra.     2) How many  MS  spectra are there in this dataset?       Hint   To answer this question you will need to use the  Select  tool from the  Filter and Sort  submenu to select lines matching the text \"MS1 spectrum\" in the whole file.  Then use the  Line/Word/Character count  tool from the  Text Manipulation  submenu to count the number of lines returned by running the  Select  tool.    More   - and here to show more   The text \"MS1 spectrum\" also appears at the top of the file as part of its description so you will need to subtract 1 from your answer     \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink5\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable5\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n            if ($(\"#showable5\").hasClass(\"showable-hidden\")) {\n                $(\"#showablelink5\").text(\"More\");\n            } else {\n                $(\"#showablelink5\").text(\"Less\");\n            }\n        });\n    });\n         \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink4\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable4\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n        Answer    3142      \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink6\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable6\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n       In the previous exercise we used two galaxy tools in succession to find out the number of items in a file that matched some text. Future exercises use the same technique so you might find it useful to create a tiny workflow to automate this proceedure.  See the instructions here   Prior to the development of tandem mass spectrometry, peptides and proteins were detected purely by matching  MS  peaks against the masses of whole peptides via  Peptide Mass Fingerprinting .  This has largely been superceded by tandem mass spectrometry which gains much greater specificity by using the  MS/MS  spectra.  In this tutorial only the  MS/MS  spectra will be used.     3) How many  MS/MS  spectra are there in this dataset?       Hint   Use the fact that the file contains a total of 24941 spectra with your answer to the previous question about  MS  spectra.     \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink8\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable8\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });\n        Answer    21799      \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink9\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable9\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    });",

It is extremely useful as it effectively converts disparate scores to the common scale of probability. The probabilities produced by  Peptide Prophet  can be used to set a threshold for acceptance.  For example we could decide to accept only PSM's with a probability greater than 0.95. Note that this is not the same as the False Discovery Rate which is computed by taking (1-p) for all the accepted PSM's and dividing by the total number of accepted PSM's.

These \u201creads\u201d vary from 20 to 1000 nucleotide base pairs (bp) in length depending on the sequencing method used.  Typically for Illumina type short read sequencing, reads of length 36 - 150 bp are produced. These reads can be either \u201csingle ended\u201d as described above or \u201cpaired end.\u201d A good summary of other types of DNA sequencing can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nPaired end reads are produced when the fragment size used in the sequencing process is much longer (typically 250 - 500 bp long) and the ends of the fragment are read in towards the middle. This produces two \u201cpaired\u201d reads. One from the left hand end of a fragment and one from the right with a known separation distance between them. (The known separation distance is actually a distribution with a mean and standard deviation as not all original fragments are of the same length.) This extra information contained in the paired end reads can be useful for helping to tie pieces of sequence together during the assembly process.\n\n\nThe goal of a sequence assembler is to produce long contiguous pieces of sequence (contigs) from these reads. The contigs are sometimes then ordered and oriented in relation to one another to form scaffolds. The distances between pairs of a set of paired end reads is useful information for this purpose.\n\n\nThe mechanisms used by assembly software are varied but the most common type for short reads is assembly by de Bruijn graph. See \nthis document\n for an explanation of the de Bruijn graph genome assembler \u201cVelvet.\u201d\n\n\nGenome assembly is a very difficult computational problem, made more difficult because many genomes contain large numbers of identical sequences, known as repeats. These repeats can be thousands of nucleotides long, and some occur in thousands of different locations, especially in the large genomes of plants and animals. [1]\n\n\nWhy do we want to assemble an organism\u2019s DNA?\n\n\nDetermining the DNA sequence of an organism is useful in fundamental research into why and how they live, as well as in applied subjects. Because of the importance of DNA to living things, knowledge of a DNA sequence may be useful in practically any biological research. For example, in medicine it can be used to identify, diagnose and potentially develop treatments for genetic diseases. Similarly, research into pathogens may lead to treatments for contagious diseases [2].\n\n\nThe protocol in a nutshell:\n\n\n\n\nObtain sequence read file(s) from sequencing machine(s).\n\n\nLook at the reads - get an understanding of what you\u2019ve got and what the quality is like.\n\n\nRaw data cleanup/quality trimming if necessary.\n\n\nChoose an appropriate assembly parameter set.\n\n\nAssemble the data into contigs/scaffolds.\n\n\nExamine the output of the assembly and assess assembly quality.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Flowchart of de novo assembly protocol.\n\n\n\n\nRaw read sequence file formats.\n\n\nRaw read sequences can be stored in a variety of formats. The reads can be stored as text in a \nFasta\n file or with their qualities as a \nFastQ\n file. They can also be stored as alignments to references in other formats such as \nSAM\n or its binary compressed implementation \nBAM\n. All of the file formats (with the exception of the binary BAM format) can be compressed easily and often are stored so (.gz for gzipped files.)\n\n\nThe most common read file format is FastQ as this is what is produced by the Illumina sequencing pipeline. This will be the focus of our discussion henceforth.\n\n\nBioinformatics tools for this protocol.\n\n\nThere are a number of tools available for each step in the genome assembly protocol. These tools all have strengths and weaknesses and have their own application space. Suggestions rather than prescriptions for tools will be made for each of the steps. Other tools could be substituted in each case depending on user preference, experience or problem type.\n\n\nGenomics Virtual Laboratory resources for this protocol.\n\n\nDepending on your requirements and skill base there are two options for running this protocol using GVL computing resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use \nGalaxy-tut\n or your own \nGVL\n server.\n\n\n\n\nAll of the suggested tools for this protocol are installed and available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re happy and comfortable using the command line, you can do this with your own \nGVL Linux\n instance on the \nNeCTAR Research Cloud\n.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the suggested tools are available on the command line as environment modules.\n\n\nEnter \nmodule avail\n at a command prompt on your instance for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use your own computing resources.\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Read Quality Control\n\n\nPurpose:\n\n\nThe purpose of this section of the protocol is to show you how to understand your raw data, make informed decisions on how to handle it and maximise your chances of getting a good quality assembly. Knowledge of the read types, the number of reads, their GC content, possible contamination and other issues are important. This information will give you an idea of any quality issues with the data and guide you on the choice of data trimming/cleanup methods to use. Cleaning up the raw data before assembly can lead to much better assemblies as contamination and low quality error prone reads will have been removed. It will also give you a better guide as to setting appropriate input parameters for the assembly software. It is a good idea to perform these steps on all of your read files as they could have very different qualities.\n\n\nSteps involved and suggested tools:\n\n\nExamine the quality of your raw read files.\n\n\nFor FastQ files (the most common), the suggested tool is \nFastQC\n. Details can be found \nhere\n. FastQC can be run from within Galaxy or by command line. (It has a GUI interface for the command line version.)\n\n\nFastQC on any GVL Galaxy is located in: \nNGS: QC and Manipulation \u2192 FastQC: Comprehensive QC\n\n\nCommand line: \nfastqc\n\n\n\n\nDetails on installation and use can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the important outputs of FastQC for our purposes are:\n\n\n\n\nRead length - Will be important in setting maximum k-mer size value for assembly\n\n\nQuality encoding type - Important for quality trimming software\n\n\n% GC - High GC organisms don\u2019t tend to assemble well and may have an uneven read coverage distribution.\n\n\nTotal number of reads - Gives you an idea of coverage..\n\n\nDips in quality near the beginning, middle or end of the reads - Determines possible trimming/cleanup methods and parameters and may indicate technical problems with the sequencing process/machine run.\n\n\nPresence of highly recurring k-mers - May point to contamination of reads with barcodes, adapter sequences etc.\n\n\nPresence of large numbers of N\u2019s in reads - May point to poor quality sequencing run. You need to trim these reads to remove N\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\nQuality trimming/cleanup of read files.\n\n\nNow that you have some knowledge about the raw data, it is important to use this information to clean up and trim the reads to improve its overall quality before assembly. There are a number of tools available in Galaxy and by command line that can perform this step (to varying degrees) but you\u2019ll need one that can handle read pairing if you\u2019ve got paired end reads. If one of the ends of a pair is removed, the orphaned read needs to be put into a separate \u201corphaned reads\u201d file. This maintains the paired ordering of the reads in the paired read files so the assembly software can use them correctly. The suggested tool for this is a pair aware read trimmer called \nTrimmomatic\n. Details on Trimmomatic can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nTrimmomatic on GVL systems: \nNGS: QC and Manipulation -\n Trimmomatic\n\n\nCommand line: details and examples \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\njava -cp \npath to trimmomatic jar\n org.usadellab.trimmomatic.TrimmomaticPE\n for Paired End Files\n\n\njava -cp \npath to trimmomatic jar\n org.usadellab.trimmomatic.TrimmomaticSE\n for Single End Files\n\n\n\n\nTrimmomatic can perform many read trimming functions sequentially.\n\n\nSuggested Trimmomatic functions to use:\n\n\n\n\nAdapter trimming\n\n\nThis function trims adapters, barcodes and other contaminants from the reads.\n\n\nYou need to supply a fasta file of possible adapter sequences, barcodes etc to trim. See Trimmomatic website for detailed instructions.\n\n\nThe default quality settings are sensible.\n\n\nThis should always be the first trimming step if it is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding window trimming\n\n\nThis function uses a sliding window to measure average quality and trims accordingly.\n\n\nThe default quality parameters are sensible for this step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailing bases quality trimming\n\n\nThis function trims bases from the end of a read if they drop below a quality threshold. e.g. If base 69 of 75 drops below the threshold, the read is cut to 68 bases.\n\n\nUse FastQC report to decide whether this step is warranted and what quality value to use. A quality threshold value of 10-15 is a good starting point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading bases quality trimming\n\n\nThis function works in a similar fashion to trailing bases trimming except it performs it at the start of the reads.\n\n\nUse FastQC report to determine if this step is warranted. If the quality of bases is poor at the beginning of reads it might be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum read length\n\n\nOnce all trimming steps are complete, this function makes sure that the reads are still longer than this value. If not, the read is removed from the file and its pair is put into the orphan file.\n\n\nThe most appropriate value for this parameter will depend on the FastQC report, specifically the length of the high quality section of the Per Base Sequence Quality graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to look for in the output:\n\n\n\n\nNumber of reads orphaned by the trimming / cleanup process.\n\n\nNumber of pairs lost totally.\n\n\n\n\nTrimmomatic should produce 2 pairs files (1 left and 1 right hand end) and 1 or 2 single \u201corphaned reads\u201d files if you trimmed a pair of read files using paired end mode. It only produces 1 output read file if you used it in single ended mode. Each read library (2 paired files or 1 single ended file) should be trimmed separately with parameters dependent on their own FastQC reports. The output files are the ones you should use for assembly.\n\n\nPossible alternate tools:\n\n\nRead quality trimming: \nnesoni clip\n, part of the \nnesoni\n suite of bioinformatics tools. Available at \nhttp://www.bioinformatics.net.au/software.shtml\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Assembly\n\n\nPurpose:\n\n\nThe purpose of this section of the protocol is to outline the process of assembling the quality trimmed reads into draft contigs. Most assembly software has a number of input parameters which need to be set prior to running. These parameters can and do have a large effect on the outcome of any assembly. Assemblies can be produced which have less gaps, less or no mis-assemblies, less errors by tweaking the input parameters. Therefore, knowledge of the parameters and their effects is essential to getting good assemblies. In most cases an optimum set of parameters for your data can be found using an iterative method.\n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t just run it once and say, \u201cI\u2019ve assembled!\u201d\n\n\nSteps involved and suggested tools:\n\n\nAssembly of the reads.\n\n\nThe suggested assembly software for this protocol is the \nVelvet Optimiser\n which wraps the Velvet Assembler. The \nVelvet\n assembler is a short read assembler specifically written for Illumina style reads. It uses the de Bruijn graph approach (see \nhere\n for details).\n\n\nVelvet and therefore the Velvet Optimiser is capable of taking multiple read files in different formats and types (single ended, paired end, mate pair) simultaneously.\n\n\nThe quality of contigs that Velvet outputs is dependent heavily on its parameter settings, and significantly better assemblies can be had by choosing them appropriately. The three most critical parameters to optimize are the hash size (k), the expected coverage (e), and the coverage cutoff (c).\n\n\nVelvet Optimiser is a Velvet wrapper that optimises the values for the input parameters in a fast, easy to use and automatic manner for all datasets. It can be run from within GVL Galaxy servers or by command line.\n\n\nIn Galaxy: \nNGS-Assembly \u2192 Velvet Optimiser\n\n\nCommand line: details and examples \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nExample command line for paired end reads in read files \nreads_R1.fq\n and \nreads_R2.fq\n using a kmer-size search range of \n63\n - \n75\n.\n\n\nVelvetOptimiser.pl -f \"-shortPaired -fastq -separate reads_R1.fq reads_R2.fq\" -s 63 -e 75 -d output_directory\n\n\n\n\nThe critical inputs for Velvet Optimiser are the read files and the k-mer size search range. The read files need to be supplied in a specific order. Single ended reads first, then by increasing paired end insert size. The k-mer size search range needs a start and end value. Each needs to be an odd integer with start \n end. If you set the start hash size to be higher than the length of any of the reads in the read files then those reads will be left out of the assembly. i.e. reads of length 36 with a starting hash value of 39 will give no assembly. The output from FastQC can be a very good tool for determining appropriate start and end of the k-mer size search range. The per base sequence quality graph from FastQC shows where the quality of the reads starts to drop off and going just a bit higher can be a good end value for the k-mer size search range.\n\n\nExamine the draft contigs and assessment of the assembly quality.\n\n\nThe Velvet Optimiser log file contains information about all of the assemblies ran in the optimisation process. At the end of this file is a lot of information regarding the final assembly. This includes some metric data about the draft contigs (n50, maximum length, number of contigs etc) as well as the estimates of the insert lengths for each paired end data set. It also contains information on where to find the final contigs.fa file.\n\n\nThe assembly parameters used in the final assembly can also be found as part of the last entry in the log file.\n\n\nThe \ncontig_stats.txt\n file associated with the assembly shows details regarding the coverage depth of each contig (in k-mer coverage terms NOT read coverage) and this can be useful information for finding repeated contigs etc.\n\n\nMore detailed metrics on the contigs can be gotten using a fasta statistics tool such as fasta-stats on Galaxy. (\nFasta Manipulation \u2192 Fasta Statistics\n).\n\n\nPossible alternative software:\n\n\nAssembly: There are a large number of short read assemblers available. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the available assemblers include:\n\n\n\n\nSpades\n\n\nSOAP-denovo\n\n\nMIRA\n\n\nALLPATHS\n\n\n\n\nSee \nhere\n for a comprehensive list of - and links to - short read assembly programs.\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: What next?\n\n\nPurpose:\n\n\nHelp determine the suitability of a draft set of contigs for the rest of your analysis and what to do with them now.\n\n\nSome things to remember about the contigs you have just produced:\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re draft contigs.\n\n\nThey may contain some gaps or regions of \u201cN\u201ds.\n\n\nThere may be some mis-assemblies.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens with your contigs next is determined by what you need them for:\n\n\n\n\nYou only want to look at certain loci or genes in your genome\n\n\nCheck and see if the regions of interest have been assembled in their entirety.\n\n\nIf they have then just use the contigs of interest.\n\n\nIf they haven\u2019t, you may need to close gaps or join contigs in these areas. See below for suggestions.\n\n\nPerforming an automatic annotation on your draft contigs can help with this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want to perform comparative genomics analyses with your contigs\n\n\nDo your contigs cover all of the regions you are interested in?\n\n\nSome of the larger repeated elements (such as the ribosomal RNA loci) may not have all been resolved correctly. Do you care about this? If so then you\u2019ll need to finish these areas to distinguish between the repeats.\n\n\nDo your contigs show a missing section of the reference genome(s) or a novel section? You may want to check that this is actually the case with some further experiments or by delving deeper into the assembly data. Some tool suggestions for this appear below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want to \u201cfinish\u201d the genome and publish it in genbank.\n\n\nCan your assembly be improved with more and/or different read data?\n\n\nCan you use other tools to improve your assembly with your current read data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible tools for improving your assemblies:\n\n\nMost of these tools are open source and freely available (or at least academically available) but some are commercial software.

There are a number of tools available in Galaxy and by command line that can perform this step (to varying degrees) but you\u2019ll need one that can handle read pairing if you\u2019ve got paired end reads. If one of the ends of a pair is removed, the orphaned read needs to be put into a separate \u201corphaned reads\u201d file. This maintains the paired ordering of the reads in the paired read files so the assembly software can use them correctly. The suggested tool for this is a pair aware read trimmer called  Trimmomatic . Details on Trimmomatic can be found  here .  Trimmomatic on GVL systems:  NGS: QC and Manipulation -  Trimmomatic  Command line: details and examples  here .   java -cp  path to trimmomatic jar  org.usadellab.trimmomatic.TrimmomaticPE  for Paired End Files  java -cp  path to trimmomatic jar  org.usadellab.trimmomatic.TrimmomaticSE  for Single End Files   Trimmomatic can perform many read trimming functions sequentially.  Suggested Trimmomatic functions to use:   Adapter trimming  This function trims adapters, barcodes and other contaminants from the reads.  You need to supply a fasta file of possible adapter sequences, barcodes etc to trim. See Trimmomatic website for detailed instructions.  The default quality settings are sensible.  This should always be the first trimming step if it is used.    Sliding window trimming  This function uses a sliding window to measure average quality and trims accordingly.  The default quality parameters are sensible for this step.    Trailing bases quality trimming  This function trims bases from the end of a read if they drop below a quality threshold. e.g. If base 69 of 75 drops below the threshold, the read is cut to 68 bases.  Use FastQC report to decide whether this step is warranted and what quality value to use. A quality threshold value of 10-15 is a good starting point.    Leading bases quality trimming  This function works in a similar fashion to trailing bases trimming except it performs it at the start of the reads.  Use FastQC report to determine if this step is warranted. If the quality of bases is poor at the beginning of reads it might be necessary.    Minimum read length  Once all trimming steps are complete, this function makes sure that the reads are still longer than this value. If not, the read is removed from the file and its pair is put into the orphan file.  The most appropriate value for this parameter will depend on the FastQC report, specifically the length of the high quality section of the Per Base Sequence Quality graph.     Things to look for in the output:   Number of reads orphaned by the trimming / cleanup process.  Number of pairs lost totally.   Trimmomatic should produce 2 pairs files (1 left and 1 right hand end) and 1 or 2 single \u201corphaned reads\u201d files if you trimmed a pair of read files using paired end mode. It only produces 1 output read file if you used it in single ended mode. Each read library (2 paired files or 1 single ended file) should be trimmed separately with parameters dependent on their own FastQC reports. The output files are the ones you should use for assembly.",

Most assembly software has a number of input parameters which need to be set prior to running. These parameters can and do have a large effect on the outcome of any assembly. Assemblies can be produced which have less gaps, less or no mis-assemblies, less errors by tweaking the input parameters. Therefore, knowledge of the parameters and their effects is essential to getting good assemblies. In most cases an optimum set of parameters for your data can be found using an iterative method.

            "text": "The suggested assembly software for this protocol is the  Velvet Optimiser  which wraps the Velvet Assembler. The  Velvet  assembler is a short read assembler specifically written for Illumina style reads. It uses the de Bruijn graph approach (see  here  for details).  Velvet and therefore the Velvet Optimiser is capable of taking multiple read files in different formats and types (single ended, paired end, mate pair) simultaneously.  The quality of contigs that Velvet outputs is dependent heavily on its parameter settings, and significantly better assemblies can be had by choosing them appropriately. The three most critical parameters to optimize are the hash size (k), the expected coverage (e), and the coverage cutoff (c).  Velvet Optimiser is a Velvet wrapper that optimises the values for the input parameters in a fast, easy to use and automatic manner for all datasets. It can be run from within GVL Galaxy servers or by command line.  In Galaxy:  NGS-Assembly \u2192 Velvet Optimiser  Command line: details and examples  here .   Example command line for paired end reads in read files  reads_R1.fq  and  reads_R2.fq  using a kmer-size search range of  63  -  75 .  VelvetOptimiser.pl -f \"-shortPaired -fastq -separate reads_R1.fq reads_R2.fq\" -s 63 -e 75 -d output_directory   The critical inputs for Velvet Optimiser are the read files and the k-mer size search range. The read files need to be supplied in a specific order. Single ended reads first, then by increasing paired end insert size. The k-mer size search range needs a start and end value. Each needs to be an odd integer with start   end. If you set the start hash size to be higher than the length of any of the reads in the read files then those reads will be left out of the assembly. i.e. reads of length 36 with a starting hash value of 39 will give no assembly. The output from FastQC can be a very good tool for determining appropriate start and end of the k-mer size search range. The per base sequence quality graph from FastQC shows where the quality of the reads starts to drop off and going just a bit higher can be a good end value for the k-mer size search range.",

What happens with your contigs next is determined by what you need them for:   You only want to look at certain loci or genes in your genome  Check and see if the regions of interest have been assembled in their entirety.  If they have then just use the contigs of interest.  If they haven\u2019t, you may need to close gaps or join contigs in these areas. See below for suggestions.  Performing an automatic annotation on your draft contigs can help with this.    You want to perform comparative genomics analyses with your contigs  Do your contigs cover all of the regions you are interested in?  Some of the larger repeated elements (such as the ribosomal RNA loci) may not have all been resolved correctly. Do you care about this? If so then you\u2019ll need to finish these areas to distinguish between the repeats.  Do your contigs show a missing section of the reference genome(s) or a novel section? You may want to check that this is actually the case with some further experiments or by delving deeper into the assembly data. Some tool suggestions for this appear below.
